We won't know the full details for some time.&quot;</p> <p>On a typical Sunday, he says, the streets would be busy with people heading to church or lunch.

But we have a UV stamp.&quot;</p> <p>The UV stamp is only visible under ultraviolet lights and is another way to disguise a visit to a strip club.

The ministry has advised against all tourist and other non-essential travel to Fiji.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;We certainly felt the impact of TC [tropical cyclone] Winston in Suva with destructive, howling winds and the sounds of rivets lifting from roofs a constant throughout the night,&quot; said Alice Clements of Unicef.</p> <p>It was still too early to tell how the country had fared, and assessments were being done by the Fiji government. As well as the damage from winds, flash flooding had been a danger, she said.</p> <p>&quot;It is likely that smaller villages across Fiji will have suffered the most, given their infrastructures would be too weak to withstand the power of a category 5 cyclone.</p> <p>&quot;Families may have lost their homes and crops, therefore leaving them without shelter, food and a livelihood. These families will have lost everything.&quot;</p> <p>Twenty four houses and a church at Nabasovi village on Koro Island have been badly damaged, Fiji radio reported on Saturday.&nbsp;</p> <p>Head of Nabasovi District School, Taura Vosayaco, told&nbsp;FBC&nbsp;News all people&nbsp;in this village&nbsp;were now being sheltered in one of the classrooms in the school and another house, which was not damaged.</p> <p>Vosayaco said the school dining hall was also destroyed and a shed for the school generator.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fiji Meteorology Office forecaster Amit Singh said </p> <p> the worst was over for Fiji and winds easing in most places, although heavy rain remained.</p> <p>Rain would continue in western parts of Fiji and flooding was an issue, he said.</p> <p>There were no reports on serious injury in Nausori, near Suva on Vitu Levu, but flooding, damage to houses and power poles had occurred in Savusavu, on Vanua Levu, while a bus was reported to have been washed inland by big tidal waves.</p> <p>After twice hammering outlying islands in nearby Tonga last week, Cyclone Winston re-intensified on Saturday and began to track west towards Suva, the capital of Fiji, packing winds of 230kmh, with gusts of up to 325kmh.</p> <p>The Fijian government declared a state of natural disaster for the next 30 days.</p> <p><b>'TERRIBLE EVENT'</b></p> <p>Hours before the storm hit land, Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama warned the nation was facing an ordeal &quot;of the most grievous kind&quot; as tropical Cyclone Winston begins to batter the country.</p> <p>He urged Fijians to prepare themselves for a &quot;terrible event&quot;.</p> <p>Fijian-born Lizann Vailasi was due to fly home to Sydney on Sunday.</p> <p>But instead she was hunkered down with her brother and his family at Pacific Harbour, south-west of Suva.</p> <p>She was mostly worried about her fellow Fijians sheltering in small towns as they wait for the worst of the wind and rain hit.</p> <p>&quot;There are thousands worse off. Fingers crossed and God willing.&quot;</p> <p>Roads with trees and powerlines covering them are closed and the Fijian Government says they will not be cleared and water supplies will not be re-established until the storm passes.</p> <p><b>KIWIS ON THE GROUND</b></p> <p>As the cyclone made landfall shortly after 8.30pm, NZ time, on Saturday, New Zealanders in Fiji reported flickering electricity and outages to internet.&nbsp;</p> <p>Leanne Goff lives on Denarau Island and at 10pm said the cyclone was &quot;really picking up now&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;Even if I wanted to I wouldn't be able to stand up outside. Between the wind and the torrential rain it sounds like a freight train outside.&nbsp;Latest report is the eye is supposed to hit us 3am, which feels like very long time away. That's hours and hours of sustained battering.&quot;</p> <p>The Hurricanes rugby team posted a message to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hurricanesrugby/?fref=ts\" target=\"_blank\">its Facebook page</a>, urging its Fijian supporters to stay safe.</p> <p>&quot;To all our friends from Fiji, the biggest ever storm ever in the Southern Hemisphere to looking you right in the eye. Please take cover and look after each other as this Cat 5 storm hits. From everyone at the Hurricanes and on behalf of NZ Kia kaha.&quot;</p> <p>The post has received hundreds of comments, many from those in Fiji sheltering from tropical cyclone Winston.</p> <p>&quot;Wind getting strong here in Nadi as well, and not feeling good knowing it's only gonna get worse,&quot; said Andrew Kang.</p> <p>Samy Lutumailagi posted &quot;We getting pounded right now. Neva seen this before. It's brutal man!&quot;</p> <p>Mark Wagner, a leadership coach visiting Fiji for a workshop, said winds were starting to pick up in Suva.</p> <p>&quot;[I have] never been in a cyclone before - this may not make sense but the wind actually sounds angry,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Arti Singh reported his family's neighbours in Suva had lost their roof as the wind gathered pace.&nbsp;</p> <p>Marijke Braaksma said her family, based in Nadi, had lost power.&nbsp;</p> <p>Caroline Gray said the noise at the Pearl Resort was deafening. &quot;I really feel for the locals, many of whom are spending the night in poorly constructed buildings.&quot;</p> <p>Tourists on the island of Naukacacuvu had to endure a rough three-hour ferry ride after being evacuated Saturday afternoon, but made it to Nadi before nightfall, and before Winston's full force hit.</p> <p><b>Click here to donate to <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org.nz/greatest-need\" target=\"_blank\">Unicef.</a></b></p> <p><b>Click <a href=\"https://www.redcross.org.nz/donate/where-the-need-is-greatest/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to donate to the Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund.</b></p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/CIMSS_Satellite\">@CIMSS_Satellite</a> shows severe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CycloneWinston?src=hash\">#CycloneWinston</a> approaching Fiji’s Viti Levu with 185 mph max winds <a href=\"https://t.co/LxSGJSy6RM\">pic.twitter.com/LxSGJSy6RM</a></p>&mdash; BuzzFeed Storm (@BuzzFeedStorm) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedStorm/status/700886205097836546\">February 20, 2016</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">more stunning, ominous Himawari satellite imagery of Severe Tropical Cyclone <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Winston?src=hash\">#Winston</a> bearing down on Fiji <a href=\"https://t.co/RuZ1r9PJxB\">pic.twitter.com/RuZ1r9PJxB</a></p>&mdash; NWS OPC (@NWSOPC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NWSOPC/status/700795050330984450\">February 19, 2016</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><blockquote class=\"twitter-video\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Savusavu at 12:30pm today.

game one in Melbourne</a>&nbsp;</b></p> <div class=\"fb-follow\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stuff.co.nz\" data-layout=\"standard\" data-show-faces=\"false\"> &nbsp; </div> <p>The two clubs have played out some epic series in recent times, and have shared the last six NBL championships between them. The Breakers defeated the Cats 2-1 in a thrilling semifinal en route to their first title in 2010-11, then accounted for the men from West Australia in the next two grand finals.</p> <p>Right now the NBL schedule has the grand finals slated to tip off on March 2, in Perth if they close the deal out against the Hawks. The next two games are down to follow soon after on March 4 (in Auckland) and March 6, if required back on the other side of the Tasman.</p> <p>That sets up a nightmare scenario for both clubs, but particularly the Breakers, given the long flights between Perth and Auckland. With just a day between each of the finals, both teams would have their recovery severely compromised, with the great part of the day between fixtures spent travelling.</p> <p>&quot;It doesn't make a lot of sense to me,&quot; said Vickerman who is looking to bow out of a nine-year association with the club with a fifth title. &quot;If one of the goals of the NBL this year was to put the best product on the floor, I'm not sure if that scenario puts the best basketball product on the floor.</p> <p>&quot;It makes it tougher, and gives them the advantage of having that home court.&quot;</p> <p>Vickerman was clearly hoping for a rethink on the schedule from the league, especially if the Wildcats also wrap up their series early, with game two of their semifinal in Wollongong on Sunday (5pm, NZT).</p> <p>&quot;Our job right now is to look forward and see what the next step is. We can get some good recovery this weekend, then get to manage our loads and manage our injuries. And we get to view another series.</p> <p>&quot;I'm not sure if the league is absolutely locked in to the days and dates. I'd love to come back here (to Vector Arena) if there was an opportunity and pack this place out.&quot;</p> <p>If the grand finals stay as scheduled, the Breakers will have to play their home game at the North Shore Events Centre, with Vector unavailable on March 4 because of a Madonna concert.</p> <p>Vickerman lauded his team for its outstanding second half against Melbourne on Saturday night, with Tom Abercrombie, Cedric Jackson and Tai Wesley leading a fightback from five points down at the half, to lead by one (58-57) at the three-quarter mark and close the deal with a 33-21 final term.</p> <p>Both Jackson and Abercrombie made a succession of dagger jump shots over the run home, while Wesley's low post presence and physicality was a huge factor. Abercrombie finished with a career playoff-high 23 points (9/15 FG, 4/6 3PT), Jackson had 19 points, eight rebounds, five assists and two steals and Wesley went toe-to-toe with NBA star Hakim Warrick en route to 16 points and six boards.</p> <p>&quot;Those two (Jackson and Abercrombie) were absolutely massive,&quot; Vickerman said. &quot;Tommy, you saw in the game over there, I just thought he really wanted the basketball at different stages and tonight you could just see there was an absolute confidence he was going to make plays.</p> <p>&quot;And Tai's defence tonight was outstanding. We know what he's capable of at the offensive end, but I thought his commitment to the defensive end was unbelievable tonight.&quot;</p> <p>As ever, contributions came right through the Breakers lineup.

McCullum lost the toss and was sent into bat on a pitch both captains felt was soft. Martin Guptill left the first ball and scored from the third, and the already full house fatalistically cheered both, as if they were the unexpected. Tom Latham made 4 from 40 balls, Kane Williamson 7 from 70 as the Kiwis toiled to 74-4. The ball stuck in the pitch, and in the hands of the Australians, brilliantly.</p> <p>McCullum arrived to a guard of honour and a handshake from Steve Smith and immediately set about rearranging the furniture and the priorities with a swipe for four from his second ball and a drive for six from his fifth. This was merely the overture.&nbsp;</p> <p>McCullum never has pretended to elegance; he prefers effect. Where Williamson had slackened his hands to deal with the swinging, lifting ball, he stiffened his. Where Williamson sometimes was adrift in the corridor of uncertainty, McCullum set about creating a force field. He has always been the type to put all of himself into his shots anyway, and let physics to the rest. Williamson's way was not wrong —&nbsp;a year of non-stop run-making shows that —&nbsp;but it was not going to succeed this day.</p> <p>If there was madness in McCullum's method, there was also method in his madness. If he could free his arms, he muscled shots more like forehands than cross-bats. If his arms were pinned, he played like a man shovelling sand, but shovelling it a long way. Two thirds of his runs came through the off field. Through or over; soon enough, it was academic. When the bowlers tried to adjust, they found that McCullum had moved the poles; off was no longer where it used to be, and nor was leg, and nor that matter was the batting crease and the batsman's guard. All had become illusions.</p> <p>Such footwork as he employed was not to manoeuvre&nbsp;around the crease, but to run at the bowler, fast, medium or slow. Pre-match, McCullum, among others, had foreshadowed that the bowlers would be licking their lips on this pitch, and for an hour or two they were. Now, though, they were pursing them, then shaping them to mouth shock or pithy imprecations.</p> <p>Here was where McCullum has taken cricket, its new cutting edge. It was the &quot;purest form&quot;, McCullum's own reverential words, modified and energised by its newest form, at which McCullum is the acknowledged master&nbsp;and, on this gloriously balmy Saturday afternoon, you would have had to cross many oceans to find anyone who was not utterly enthralled. By the time he was done, he had crashed as many sixes in two hours as Don Bradman had in his entire test career.</p> <p>In Wellington, Corey Anderson had tried to play like a batsman and tied himself up. Here, with McCullum as partner, model and inspiration,&nbsp;he reverted to batter, opening his scoring with a swish to leg for six and so falling in with McCullum's beat. Together, they put on 179 at 10 an over, and, no, there is no missing decimal point.</p> <p>Everything about the day was amped up, including the turning point. McCullum, then 39, was balletically caught in gully from what proved to be another James Pattinson no-ball. How Hagley Oval roared then. Yes, he had luck, but increasingly it felt like the luck due the brave, as McCullum had prophesied, and then the luck of the destined. It was brave to play test cricket this way.</p> <p>Smith and Australia had no solution. How could they have had, to a problem they had not met before, search their laptops as they might? Batting power play without end: how do you bowl to that, what field do you set? In the stasis of the morning, it had been easy enough. Smith even had Warner stand at a kind of advance third slip, crowding Williamson bodily and in mind. They had also caught brilliantly, but that was in another reality. Australia will have to find answers soon, because McCullum has opened up new vistas and possibilities&nbsp;in test cricket. Smith's best guess this day was a fly slip, and at length a fieldsman directly behind the wicketkeeper. McCullum clouted the next ball, his 54th, between the shrinking cover fieldsmen to go to 100.</p> <p>McCullum had stayed in the moment, but now it engulfed him. He took a second to absorb it, hugged Anderson, accepted Smith's chivalrous handshake, returned the crowd's salute, and then took another second for absorption.</p> <p>Whether there was anything left in the pitch no longer mattered; the Kiwis weren't taking any notice of it, nor the identities and reputations of the bowlers, nor the subtleties of field placements. McCullum holed out, but the balance of the batting rattled along at six-an-over to 370. Altogether, there were 46 fours and 12 sixes. It won't alway work. But the Kiwis had convinced themselves that orthodox progression would not have worked this day, either, and the siege of the first hour or so had verified it. So McCullum changed the rules and moved the goalposts.</p> <p>For Australia's innings, it was back to classic&nbsp;day one script, probing swing and seam, watchful batting and duly the wicket of the itchy&nbsp;David Warner, fencing a lifter to slip. On swansong day one,&nbsp;McCullum had written a happy ending for himself and at least the possibility of one for his team. For now, though, he was re-writing only autograph books.</p>","images":[{"id":13978303,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T103604+1300","datetime_display":"10:36

class=\"fb-follow\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stuff.co.nz\" data-layout=\"standard\" data-show-faces=\"false\"> &nbsp; </div> <p>&quot;There is something vaguely Arthurian about Brendon McCullum, the preordained king of New Zealand cricket,&quot; Coverdale mused.</p> <p>&quot;Mike Hesson, the nerdiest Merlin possible,&nbsp;spotted McCullum as a child, and recognised the signs. At their round table every team member is equal, and adheres to a code that is almost chivalric. The country has united behind McCullum. He should really brandish&nbsp;an Excalibur bat.</p> <p>&quot;Whatever the case, he wields it like a madman. Sometimes it feels more like the bat is controlling McCullum than vice-versa.&quot;</p> <p>Commenting on the front-foot no-ball from James Pattinson that denied Mitchell Marsh of a stunning catch to remove McCullum on 39, Coverdale said it always felt like McCullum would make a special contribution at some stage during the series.</p> <p>&quot;This really&nbsp;<i>was</i>&nbsp;McCullum's day,&quot; he said. &quot;After that it was a series of slap-downs. Fifty off 34 balls when he crunched Jackson Bird for six over long-on. Before you knew it he was in the eighties, and Smith was in such a spin he'd forgotten to use Nathan Lyon yet.</p> <p>&quot;Like one of his cherished race-horses, he had positioned himself one out and one back, ready for his run to the line. A hundred in 54 balls. The end of a record that stood for nearly 30 years.</p> <p>&quot;To watch an innings like this, it seems remarkable that McCullum will not play in the World Twenty20 this year. 'It's nice to be able to go out in the purest form of the game,&quot; he said before the test.</p> <p>&quot;It is an admirable sentiment even if his innings was far from the purity Don Bradman wrote of in&nbsp;<i>How to Play Cricket</i>. But it was a different kind of pure. It was pure McCullum.&quot;</p> <p>In the UK, Telegraph scribe Scyld Berry called McCullum &quot;inspirational&quot; and said he deserved to be the outright record holder ahead of Richards and ul-Haq.</p> <p>&quot;The game-situation when he went in was infinitely more challenging.</p> <p>&quot;Richards and Misbah had scored their 56-ball centuries on flat pitches against demoralised attacks in the process of setting up a third-innings declaration for their teams. Brilliant strokeplay, in both cases, but they were ramming home a long-held advantage against beaten opponents.</p> <p>&quot;McCullum had lost the toss on a grassy seamer's pitch which gave Australia's captain Steve Smith no hesitation in deciding to bowl first ... [he] promptly turned the game on its head, which neither Richards nor Misbah had to do.&quot;</p> <p>Berry agreed with popular sentiment that the innings was one of the &quot;greatest counterattacks&quot; in test history, before praising McCullum for what he had done for cricket in New Zealand.</p> <p>&quot;If not a great batsman, as his career test average is less than 40, McCullum will now go down as a player of some great innings; and as a great leader for the impact he has had on his sport, and not only in New Zealand but elsewhere, such as England, where he inspired the current players with his fearless attitude.</p> <p>&quot;McCullum has popularised cricket as never before in the land of the All Blacks, by driving his team to the World Cup final last year and by enlivening, even enriching, test cricket ... McCullum, aged 34, ripped up and re-wrote the record-book.&quot;</p> <p>Focusing on how the innings had taken a huge dint out of their team's chances of wrapping up a 2-0 series victory on new Zealand soil, the Australia media were equally lavish in their praise of McCullum.</p> <p>Daily Telegraph writer Ben Horne wrote that &quot;Australia's tilt for the No 1 test ranking has been rocked to its foundations by the greatest batting hurricane of all time,&quot; adding the knock will be remembered for as long as cricket is played and &quot;the Australians only had themselves to blame for the carnage that turned the second test on its head.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Australia have been dreaming of lifting the ICC's test champion Mace all week, but yesterday they were smashed over the head repeatedly by another blunt object and now Usman Khawaja and Joe Burns must rally in the morning if the visitors are to rise from the canvast.&quot;</p> <p>Sydney Morning Herald cricket journalist Andrew Wu said Australia's hopes of reclaiming the No 1 ranking were in the balance after McCullum's innings had left them &quot;shellshocked&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;New Zealand's innings&nbsp;could be divided into three phases. Before&nbsp;McCullum&nbsp;had batted, while he was at the crease&nbsp;and when he was back in the&nbsp;pavilion.&nbsp;The latter two were played in fast forward, the button pushed as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;McCullum&nbsp;came in.</p> <p>&quot;For just over two hours, the retiring star&nbsp;had a capacity crowd at Hagley Oval eating out of his hands - and an Australian XI wishing he had already bowed out. They had welcomed him to the middle with a guard of honour only for&nbsp;McCullum&nbsp;to treat their bowlers with disdain.</p> <p>​&quot;To&nbsp;describe&nbsp;McCullum's&nbsp;as a fairytale century would not be apt&nbsp;because fairytales are not meant to be this brutal.&quot;</p>","images":[{"id":13978287,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T103531+1300","datetime_display":"10:35

way of drawing attention to their situation, but there is nothing funny about the dire financial predicament faced by a young Hamilton couple trapped under a mountain of bad credit.</p> <p>And while Kirsten Eaton-Luster and Brad Sherratt's tactics might be tongue-in-cheek, they certainly aren't a pair of bludgers appealing for a handout. The couple are full-time workers who, like many poorer New Zealanders, had deliberately taken on debt in order to improve their living standards.</p> <p>These included a $17,000 loan for a car, and a similar amount for a utility truck, through credit firms Finance Now and Instant Finance. Eaton-Luster also found herself facing an unexpected $7000 dental bill, which she paid for through her Q Card account.</p> <p>As Eaton-Luster explained, taking out loans to cover these expenses seemed to be a smart tactic, as long as no unforseen disasters occurred.</p> <p>But then a couple of unforseen disasters occurred.</p> <p>&quot;We were both in really good jobs and had knocked a fair bit off those loans,&quot; Eaton-Luster said. &quot;But about a year ago I was diagnosed with severe anxiety, and I found I could no longer cope with that role. I had to leave.&quot;</p> <p>In June Sherratt badly injured his back while at work. Although his main job is driving trucks he had also been digging trenches and had displaced some of the discs and torn a muscle - ailments that kept him out of work and on ACC for the next six months.&nbsp;</p> <p>Although they are both now back at work, the income hiatus was all it took for the interest to grow on their debts, and submerge them deeper than ever.</p> <p>Faced with the crippling commitments, the desperate pair have resorted to humour as an interim measure.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.trademe.co.nz/business-farming-industry/other/auction-1037254384.htm\" target=\"_blank\">cheeky TradeMe listing</a> will be followed by many bona fide ones, as they attempt to sell as much of their possessions - including the car - as they can to reduce the mountain.</p> <p>&quot;You will be bidding on a better future for a young couple, who have made some silly financial decisions thus far in life,&quot; the listing states. &quot;You will be helping to get them out of crippling debt ...

They are inflated with power, confidence and personality.<br /> <br /> They are hard to miss, impossible to ignore. But during this city's fashion week, these big clothes have nearly gone unmentioned.<br /> <br /> Instead, the industry has been fretting about the role of traditional runway shows in the current non-stop media environment and changes in the way consumers are shopping. These logistics will take more than a season or two to sort out, but they are not especially unusual. Every other industry is grappling with new technologies, trying to find a footing in order to move forward and thrive.<br /> <br /> But fashion tells us something about how women are perceived in this moment, how they are living and their current priorities and desires. This is a moment of historical significance with the possibility of the first female president and more women sliding into combat roles. Violence against women is big part of the social conversation, and we are reassessing definitions of gender, reconsidering ideal body shapes and asking ourselves what it means to be feminine.<br /> <br /> <b>READ MORE:<br /> *&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/fashion/65378689/mom-jeans-replace-skinny-jeans-craze\" target=\"_blank\">'Mom' jeans replace skinny jeans craze</a>&nbsp;<br /> *&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/fashion/68124910/The-death-of-skinny-jeans-according-to-Google\" target=\"_blank\">The death of skinny jeans, according to Google</a></b></p> <div class=\"fb-follow\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stuff.co.nz\" data-layout=\"standard\" data-show-faces=\"false\"> &nbsp; </div> <p>As we navigate those quandaries, fashion is created. It must conjure desire, solve problems, make women swoon.</p> <p>If there has been a single thread running through Fall 2016 collections, it's a shift in proportion. Prepare to be swallowed by your clothes. Skinny jeans belong to another era. Retire the jeggings.</p> <p>Designers have embraced oversized silhouettes in trousers, coats and sweaters. The list of brands signing on to this new roominess range from DKNY and Rag and Bone to Zero Maria Cornejo, Coach and most majestically, Marc Jacobs.</p> <p>Jacobs' show served as the finale to this city's runway season and it was 17 minutes of focused, exhilarating ideas. He mounted his show in the Park Avenue Armory, a vast space with an expansive white set surrounded by four rows of stacked seating. In his show notes, Jacobs explained that he was inspired by the Japanese musician Keiji Haino and a quote attributed to him about his work: &quot;defying the notion that you can't create something from nothing.&quot;</p> <p>The first models emerged to the sound of a pinging bell. They were like Giacometti giants in Brobdingnagian clothes as they moved around the room on massive platform boots. A gray cardigan looked as if its sleeves were five feet long, its back stretching four feet from side to side. It was adorned with a swirl of jet beads. Patchwork dresses flowed on and on -- an endless river of richly hued satin and silk.</p> <p>There were patchwork coats that looked as though they had been assembled from a little of this and a little of that, the sum being more elegantly eccentric than the individual parts.</p> <p>Each garment became more intriguing the closer and longer one looked. It revealed itself slowly and delighted the eye. The clothes were fascinating. Even Lady Gaga, who walked the runway as a model, submersed herself in the clothes. She was not the star; Jacobs' oversize coat with fur sleeves was.</p> <p>The design duo behind Proenza Schouler alternated between knit dresses that hugged the body and trousers that almost floated around it. Each model had a nearly triangular silhouette created by clothes that fell down and out from a narrow shoulder frame.</p> <p>Jackets laced up like corsets and skirts were crafted from strips of fabric that wrapped loosely and erratically around the body. No one would declare such volume an easy style to wear. No one slips unnoticed into a room dragging extra yards of fabric. Oversized clothes announce your presence. The young men of early rap understood that. They dressed in big clothes, in part, to be big. They would not be ignored.</p> <p>At Calvin Klein, designer Francisco Costa brings artful details -- broken seams, frayed hems -- to roomy blazers and trousers. Elegant black dresses with starburst pleats form a straight line down the torso. Curves are under wraps. The line is the star.</p> <p>And Thom Browne might have taken his audience into wonderland of doggy-shaped handbags and embroidery, but his clothes were strong and bold and serious. A coat was layered with another coat. A jacket sat on top of a blazer.</p> <p>Clothes have become disconnected from the body. And it may have to do with our changing relationship to gender. It is being redefined as on a continuum rather than as a matter of either/or. The clothes are less likely to highlight hourglass shapes, cleavage, hips or other physical markers of masculinity and femininity. The clothes can be dramatic and dazzling, but they do not define us.</p> <p>No other brand underscores that more than Hood by Air. Designer Shayne Oliver stepped into fashion a few seasons ago with a mission of blurring gender lines and upending expectations. His influence rippled through the industry, seeping into Rihanna's collaboration with Puma and into brands such as Rag and Bone. His fall show was a controlled chaos of models strutting and running, preening and stumbling. Men wore spike heels. Women wore the face of brooding aggression. Black shearling jackets hung off the body like dark, flapping wings. Coats swaddled the torso.</p> <p>For some designers who see themselves as more connected to urban street culture than the boardroom or the charity circuit, the oversized clothes are worn on the runway with swagger. The models -- male and female -- are vaguely androgynous. Women do not move softly or daintily on wobbly heels. They stalk; they stomp in combat boots.</p> <p>There is overt power in these clothes. This is an election in which the look of power -- commander-in-chief power -- could be historically altered. A woman could be the face of ultimate clout. And so designers offer up a next generation of power dressing. It is not rooted in the old notions of trim suits and sheath dresses and sturdy heels. That look is obsolete, ineffective. The new cynosure is big. The clothes allow women to take up more space. They can fill a room with their physical presence.</p> <p>The work coming out of old-guard houses seems too gentle and precious for these times of brawling politics and incivility. The clothes from Carolina Herrera and Oscar de la Renta's Peter Copping are so pretty. They seem to have come from a era before Martin Skreli and the San Francisco tech bro who complained to the mayor about the unsightly homeless people. People are mean. We need clothes as armor, not as artifice.</p> <p>Perhaps we can still connect with them in the evening, on formal occasions when we are more mannered or when our tone has been softened by a cocktail or two. The beauty is undeniable The question is whether, as a culture, we can appreciate it.</p> <p>So for fall, Jacobs suggests putting on a game face -- not a pretty face.</p> <p>These are times of political brawling, the Zika virus, terrorist fears, anger, rage, vitriol. Fashion is not here to put a gloss on reality. It's trying to help you survive it all.</p>","images":[{"id":13978152,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T101601+1300","datetime_display":"10:16 21/02/2016","creditline":"supplied","source_code":"the-nelson-mail","source_name":"The Nelson Mail","caption":"A model wears Denny Rose skinny jeans","variants":[{"id":13978152,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456002961/152/13978152.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"59"}]},{"id":13978153,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T101601+1300","datetime_display":"10:16 21/02/2016","creditline":"Getty Images","caption":"Rejoice!

It wasn't a forced friendship.</p> <p>They both seem quite happy, relaxed girls. They've both got older brothers so they are into a little bit of boisterous boy play. Although, in some ways they are quite different. Alyssa is a very feminine wee girl that likes to dress up and Lola prefers to be a bit more of the tomboy. Maybe they compliment each other, in that sense.</p> <p>Their brothers were both friends and then they just developed a really lovely friendship, which they will probably have forever and they've got something really special in common.</p> <p>She's aware of her birthday and the significance of it and that she's particularly special. Especially when other people meet her and find out about when her birthday is, they see her as this very happy, little symbol of hope for the future. I know that she's going to have that as part of her life forever.</p> <p>They haven't seen each other for a couple of months now but their friendship is like they only saw each other last week. They've got that connection.</p> <p><b>Alyssa Blackman/ </b>I like Lola because she talks about silly things with me.&nbsp;We like playing funny Barbie games.</p> <p><b>Maria Romero/ </b>I used to look after<b>&nbsp;</b>Alyssa's brother a lot and we used to do swapsies. When we had playdates they would play together and then they started having the same photos together. She's really proud of her and her friend Alyssa - the 'earthquake babies'.</p> <p>They're sweet little girls. They like the same things. They like playing fairies and when they come round to play I won't see them for a few hours. They'll hide and play with all their dollies.</p> <p>I just love it because it's a positive story and it makes a lot of people in Christchurch smile.&nbsp;</p> <p>They are symbols of hope. It's not all doom and gloom. They're a sign of the rebuild as friendships happened, communities stuck together and people fell in love with strangers because of the unconditional help they received. Friends became family.</p> <p><b>Lola Romero/ </b>I like Alyssa because she's funny. She says funny stuff. We like playing and we like <i>Frozen</i>.

So, not even a lightning-in-a-bottle championship run, and a significant All Black upgrade, changes their mindset heading into the new Super Rugby season.</p> <p>Last year they thrived as the perceived misfits and cast-offs who came together in the deep south determined to prove their worth, and silence their detractors. It was a formula that reaped spectacular rewards, and ultimately a historic title snatched from the Hurricanes in dramatic fashion.</p> <p>So, as workhorse lock and team funny-man Joe Wheeler tells it, nothing changes down in Dunners for 2016. They might have a certain gleaming trophy on their mantelpiece, and a bit more respect around the traps, but they still see themselves as the team no-one rates flying firmly under the radar.</p> <p>It's probably a simplistic view, for assuredly Jamie Joseph's men have captured everyone's attention on what they put together last season. Their finals run, that saw them topple the Chiefs at home, and then the Waratahs and Hurricanes on the road, ensured that. Their All Black quota also grew from three to five, with Lima Sopoaga and Waisake Naholo joining the big three of Ben Smith, Aaron Smith and Malakai Fekitoa.</p> <p><b>READ MORE:<br /> * <a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/77071530/highlanders-finish-strongly-to-defeat-waratahs-in-final-preseason-match.html\" target=\"_blank\">Strong finish to pre-season</a><br /> *&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/super-rugby/77092423/aaron-cruden-passes-first-test-as-chiefs-go-down-to-blues\">Cruden passes first test<br /> </a>*&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/77059764/hurricanes-flog-crusaders-in-last-preseason-match\">Hurricanes flog Crusaders<br /> </a>*&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/super-rugby/77055877/james-broadhursts-concussion-headache-wont-go-away\">Concussion headache won't go away<br /> </a>*&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/super-rugby/77053751/all-blacks-great-justin-marshall-passes-secrets-to-australian-no-9-nick-phipps\">AB hands secrets to Aussies</a>&nbsp;</b></p> <div class=\"fb-follow\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stuff.co.nz\" data-layout=\"standard\" data-show-faces=\"false\"> &nbsp; </div> <p>But Wheeler is adamant the Highlanders feel no pressure as defending champs for the simple reason that they don't view themselves that way.</p> <p>&quot;Pressure is an external thing,&quot; he says. &quot;It's created by the media, not by us, and it's just whether you buy into that. We don't buy into that hype. We are down the bottom of the south, so we don't get a hell of a lot of that media attention, whereas guys like the Blues are in the hub of it all even when they're not playing well.</p> <p>&quot;But we're fine with that. That's the way we like it and hopefully it stays like that.&quot;</p> <p>It's hard to fault the Highlanders' circle-the-wagons approach because it clearly worked for them. Playing with a ton of blue collar up front and lashings of verve and swerve in their backs proved an enticing combination that teams struggled to match.</p> <p>Adds Wheeler: &quot;I'd say the TAB probably have us as outsiders, halfway down the table which is just how we like it. We've got a forward pack with no All Blacks in it but we work hard for each other. And we've got a backline with some world-class athletes. If we can get them enough ball hopefully we can play some more of the rugby that we did last year.&quot;</p> <p>Wheeler is sort of right about the TAB. The oddsmakers have them as equal fifth favourites, tucked behind the Chiefs, Hurricanes, Waratahs and Brumbies and alongside the Crusaders who didn't make the finals last season, have lost their two legendary cornerstones and have just shipped 70-odd in their last pre-season hit-out.</p> <p>More grist for the mill, no doubt.</p> <p>But he's dead right about the peculiar balance of their side. There are no big names in their forwards but plenty of big games. They have a whole contingent who all play in a similar fashion − head down, bum up and take a backward step to no man. Mongrels, you might say.</p> <p>&quot;We understand our roles inside out, and we play for each other,&quot; adds Wheeler. &quot;We're down there to prove a point and we want to show everyone we're handy footy players as well. The biggest thing is buying into one common goal, and if you get that in any team it's a strong and powerful thing.</p> <p>&quot;We're nomads really, we come from all over the country, and we all come to little old Dunedin looking for a little bit of gold. What you find is that guys are willing to go that extra mile because they're so far away from family and they've only got one choice, and that's to buy into the brotherhood of the Highlanders.&quot;</p> <p>It all helps. But the reality is they have actually put together a pretty fine rugby team to go with the Kumbaya approach. And with the best player retention of the five Kiwi franchises, they start a long way down the track in 2016, never mind the season-ending injury to glue guy Richard Buckman.</p> <p>Those rough-'n-tough forwards are just about all back, with Liam Squire and Luke Whitelock added, and any backline book-ended by those fabulous Smiths, with the firepower of Fekitoa, Naholo and Pat Osborne to call on, has to be respected.</p> <p>Wheeler talks about the team embracing an ethos that &quot;these are the greatest days of our lives&quot; and all indications are that down south they have a group of men intent on enjoying their pomp. Back to back is on − you just won't hear it from them.</p><iframe src=\"http://renderer.qmerce.com/interaction/56c5486fb6c51fb652e631ac\"  width=\"100%\" height=\"545\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>","images":[{"id":13977361,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T073120+1300","datetime_display":"07:31 21/02/2016","creditline":"GETTY IMAGES","caption":"Ben Smith and Nasi Manu hold the Super Rugby trophy aloft after last year's fairytale campaign.","variants":[{"id":13977361,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455993080/361/13977361.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"60"}]},{"id":13977362,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T073120+1300","datetime_display":"07:31 21/02/2016","creditline":"GETTY IMAGES","caption":"Ben Smith and Nasi Manu hold the Super Rugby trophy aloft after last year's fairytale campaign.","variants":[{"id":13977362,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455993080/362/13977362.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"620","height":"349"}]},{"id":13977363,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T073120+1300","datetime_display":"07:31 21/02/2016","creditline":"GETTY IMAGES","caption":"Ben Smith and Nasi Manu hold the Super Rugby trophy aloft after last year's fairytale campaign.","variants":[{"id":13977363,"layout":"Strap Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455993080/363/13977363.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"300","height":"200"}]},{"id":13977365,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T073120+1300","datetime_display":"07:31 21/02/2016","creditline":"GETTY IMAGES","caption":"Ben Smith and Nasi Manu hold the Super Rugby trophy aloft after last year's fairytale campaign.","variants":[{"id":13977365,"layout":"Defcon Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455993080/365/13977365.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"418","height":"220"}]},{"id":13977366,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T073120+1300","datetime_display":"07:31 21/02/2016","creditline":"PHOTOSPORT","caption":"Ben Smith and his Highlanders will not let success go to their heads as they look to repeat their Super Rugby heroics.","variants":[{"id":13977366,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455993080/366/13977366.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"620","height":"349"}]},{"id":13977367,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T073120+1300","datetime_display":"07:31 21/02/2016","creditline":"PHOTOSPORT","caption":"Ben Smith and his Highlanders will not let success go to their heads as they look to repeat their Super Rugby heroics.","variants":[{"id":13977367,"layout":"Defcon Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455993080/367/13977367.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"418","height":"220"}]},{"id":13977368,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T073120+1300","datetime_display":"07:31 21/02/2016","creditline":"PHOTOSPORT","caption":"Ben Smith and his Highlanders will not let success go to their heads as they look to repeat their Super Rugby heroics.","variants":[{"id":13977368,"layout":"ipad section splash 956:956","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455993080/368/13977368.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"956","height":"956"}]}]},{"id":76992172,"path":"/dominion-post/news/76992172/Live-blog-Cigna-Round-the-Bays-Wellington-2016","url":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/_json/dominion-post/news/76992172/Live-blog-Cigna-Round-the-Bays-Wellington-2016","section":"Stuff","section-home":"News","section-top-level":"Dominion Post","layout":"landscape-image","title":"Live blog: Cigna Round the Bays Wellington 2016","subhead":null,"alt_headline":"Live blog: Round the Bays","datetime_iso8601":"20160221T072703+1300","datetime_display":"07:27 21/02/2016","byline":null,"source_code":"the-dominion-post","source_name":"The Dominion Post","intro":"Welcome to this year's Cigna Round The Bays in Wellington.","alt_intro":"We want to see you round the bays, so send us your pics and tweets.","body":"<p>Welcome to this year's Cigna Round The Bays in Wellington.</p> <p>Send us your tweets, comments and videos by including #CignaRTB and @dompost in any post.</p> <p>So, on your marks, get set and scroll down for the blog.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"scrbbl-embed\" data-src=\"/event/1854660/30418\"></div>\n<script>(function(d, s, id) {var js,ijs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(d.getElementById(id))return;js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://embed.scribblelive.com/widgets/embed.js\";ijs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ijs);}(document, 'script', 'scrbbl-js'));</script>","images":[{"id":13977349,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T072730+1300","datetime_display":"07:27 21/02/2016","creditline":"ROSS GIBLIN / FAIRFAX NZ","caption":"Time flies when you're having fun ...

I immediately saw it held quite a large resemblance to mine,&quot; said Stewart.<br /> <br /> His box idea had been inspired by requests to cater for events which were too small to justify bringing along his converted 5.6 metre Ford truck.<br /> <br /> &quot;I scoured the internet quite a bit and found nothing similar,&quot; he said.<br /> <br /> &quot;I built a prototype just out of glue and plywood, created the different compartments and made it to size.&quot;<br /> <br /> The test run was successful, and Stewart invested the truck's summer profits in getting a carpenter mate to build five units.<br /> <br /> &quot;It works better than I anticipated, and we're getting a lot of repeat business,&quot; he said.<br /> <br /> Stewart said he had initially looked into protecting his design, but was told getting a watertight patent would be prohibitively expensive.</p> <p>Instead, his lawyer sent a letter to Burger King on the basis of inherent copyright.</p> <p>&quot;We asked that once the campaign finished, they would agree not to use the box moving forward - to which they said they wouldn't consider the letter.&quot;</p> <p>Stewart said he did not have high hopes the move would achieve much.<br /> <br /> &quot;It was going to be too expensive to even attempt anything, I was well aware of that.<br /> <br /> &quot;It was really to confront BK as opposed to sitting back and not doing anything.&quot;<br /> <br /> Burger King said it had never heard of The Roaming Dive or its DIY boxes prior to receiving the letter.<br /> <br /> James Woodbridge, general manager of marketing at owner the Antares Restaurant Group, said the design was not unique.</p> <p>&quot;Our development and inspiration came from reviewing international designs,&quot; he said.</p> <p>&quot;It appears to us that here was a small brand with an idea, trying to build some publicity for their business by taking a shot at a larger brand.&quot;</p> <p>The burger battle may end without any condiments being spilled.</p> <p>Stewart, a Burger King fan himself, said imitation was the sincerest form of flattery.</p> <p>&quot;The fact that such a player would use something similar in a pretty large competition, there is a little bit of pride in the idea there.&quot;</p> <p>Woodbridge said Burger King's business model did not involve catering, and it had no plans to roll out the boxes for sale.</p> <p>He said the campaign, developed by creative agency Colenso BBDO, was going well.</p> <p>&quot;We've had a parachute club wanting it for cooking Whoppers at 15,000 feet, campgrounds BBQing on the beach, construction sites, and uni kids wanting it for their O-week party.&quot;</p>","images":[{"id":13968616,"datetime_iso8601":"20160219T171856+1300","datetime_display":"17:18 19/02/2016","creditline":"JASON DORDAY/FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"Food truck guy Peter Stewart owns The Roaming Dive, and made a a 'DIY burger box' for catering, where they drop off all the food to a party and people assemble their own burgers.

I decided to pack up my life and move here to pursue my dream of being a professional athlete and training Brazilian jiu-jitsu full-time at one of the best gyms in the world.</p> <p><b>What do you do there?</b><br /> I train full-time Monday to Friday which usually includes a strength training programme in the morning and two jiu-jitsu training sessions through the remainder of the day. On Wednesdays, I usually try and partake in some freestyle wrestling training at an Olympic training facility. Saturdays I will usually do some additional training in other areas to improve things like cardio and flexibility.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>What are the greatest advantages to living there? Disadvantages?</b><br /> I would have to say the greatest advantage would be the weather, which is amazing almost all of the time - even during the winter it's hot enough to go swimming at the beach. Also the cost of living is much lower than New Zealand. There are obvious disadvantages, such as crime and personal safety but I would urge this isn't a big enough problem to discourage people from visiting. The language barrier can be tough at times as very few people speak English, so learning Portuguese is a must for day-to-day life.</p> <p><b>How expensive is it compared to New Zealand? How much is a beer?</b><br /> Some things like rent and other bills are almost comparable with New Zealand which came as a big surprise to me at first, although I've been told by locals this is simply indicative of city life. Outside the main city limits you can expect bills to be a lot lower. Other costs of living, such as food and transport, are much lower - you can pick up a can of beer in the supermarket here for about 70 cents.</p> <p><b>What do you do in your spare time?</b><br /> In my spare time I travel to various other parts of Brazil, usually to participate in jiu-jitsu competitions. I've slowly been making my way through the various tourist sites here in Rio such as Christ The Redeemer, Escadaria Selaron and others. My apartment is only two blocks from Copacabana Beach, or a 10 minute bike ride to Ipanema beach so I can go and have a swim or relax there should the mood strike me. Learning Portuguese is also high in the priority list so I use various learning resources and speak with locals whenever possible.</p> <p><b>What's the local delicacy and would you recommend eating it?</b><br /> The most popular local delicacy is a cocktail called a &quot;Caipirinha&quot;&nbsp;which normally consists of limes, sugar and a rather generous amount of a local liquor called &quot;Cachaca&quot; very similar to rum. As far as food goes, a must-try would have to be Feijoada a kind of black bean stew that is usually slow-cooked with large chunks of fatty beef.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Easiest way to get around?</b><br /> The easiest way to get around would be the underground metro system, which is both inexpensive and (usually) reliable, with a number of extra stations being built for the upcoming Olympics. Buses are always an inexpensive way to get around and will take you almost anywhere you need to go but the drivers make no excuses for their fast and erratic driving style, so be prepared for a speed thrill.</p> <p><b>What's the shopping like?</b><br /> As far as shopping for things such as electronics, clothes and shoes, Brazil is probably not the best place to go on a shopping spree. Brazil has a number of laws regarding importing goods that incur rather hefty taxes on almost any item - even shopping online from home. For example, Brazil is the most expensive place in the world to buy Apple products.</p> <p><b>Best after-dark activity?</b><br /> Either going to the local bar/nightclub district named &quot;Lapa&quot;, once a very shady place that is now gentrified to be the number one party area, or a neighbourhood samba street party. Both activities boast a large volume of locals all drinking, dancing and having a good time, with great Brazilian samba music to accompany the atmosphere.</p> <p><b>Best time of year to visit?</b><br /> The best time to visit would be between March and September. During this time it's not summer so the temperatures are not unbearably hot, but coming from New Zealand you will still feel too hot almost every day and will likely need shorts and a singlet. Outside of these months is generally considered to be the high tourist season and most local businesses will increase their prices almost two or three-fold, so this is something to be avoided.</p> <p><b>What are the top three things you recommend for visitors?</b><br /> 1. Visit Copacabana or Ipanema beach and enjoy the sun, sand and surf. Maybe pickup a Caipirinha or two from one of the local vendors walking the length of the beach with a waiter's tray of cocktails.<br /> 2. Try a restaurant with a good Brazilian barbecue grill. Brazilians are famous for their barbecue and salted, cured meats so finding a restaurant that will carve the meat fresh from the grill is a must do.<br /> 3. Attend a street samba party. These parties are rich in culture and due to most bars and nightclubs having door charges, the street parties are where you will find locals in their regular party element. The music and dancing are sublime as well as cheap drinks all around.</p> <p><b>Besides family and friends, what do you miss most about home?</b><br /> Coffee. Being from Wellington, I am used to having amazing coffee every day. Despite Brazil being the largest coffee producer in the world, it seems they export most of the good stuff overseas and their actual coffee drinking culture appears to come from the Portuguese, where the coffee is as dark as can be. Everyone enjoys boiling hot, burnt-tasting espressos. Some mornings I wake up and think I would give my left arm for a perfect flat white.</p> <p><b>How easy is it for you to get back to NZ?</b><br /> There are no direct flights to Brazil currently from New Zealand, meaning flights can be long and expensive. Air New Zealand is beginning a new flight route to Argentina this year, which should make the trip a lot more affordable and easier.</p> <p><b>For Kiwis looking to move there, which industries are seeking fresh talent?</b><br /> Brazil's economy has seen better days since its boom about 10 years ago and the currency appears to be on the decline. However, the country will always have a large oil and gas industry with most of its economy relying on oil exports. A high number of expats I have met so far have all worked in the oil industry at some point, where there is a lot of money to be made - including large perks for expenses and travel. Aside from oil and gas, I'd say the largest opportunity for expats would come via linguistics and helping with teaching English and translations, so if you speak Portuguese this is a real bonus.</p>

We've spent the whole day preparing as best we can, as we really only got confirmation about 10pm last night we were definitely going to be hit.&quot;</p> <p>Late on Saturday night, electricity was out at their home in Denarau Island, west of Nadi, and internet was sporadic, but Goff had a generator, so was able to continue using some power.</p> <p>&quot;The worst finally seems to be over, we still have intense rain but the wind has definitely moved away,&quot; Goff said early Sunday morning. &quot;The kids have done remarkably well and we have slept together in the safest room of the house. It's roasting hot as there is no power, usually we have both fans and aircon on. Thankfully they managed some sleep but&nbsp;I'm pretty exhausted!&quot;</p> <p>Goff's children,&nbsp;Scarlett, 7, Tyson and Portia, both 6, had been kept occupied watching Peppa Pig on Saturday night.</p> <p>She said the storm outside sounded &quot;like a freight train&quot;, and she was concerned about how many Fijian homes would fare during the storm.</p> <p>&quot;I'm feeling a little bit nervous, just in terms of how bad it will get and because my kids are here - I hate thinking of how scared they'll be. The worst part, though, is i'm worried for my staff, some of which are not in as robust housing as we are ... And thinking about the people in the villages in their simple homes makes me feel very worried and hope they have gone to stay somewhere safer.&quot;</p> <p>Some friends had left Denarau first thing on Saturday, and others were staying at resorts, which were better equipped to withstand the storm.</p> <p>&quot;Certainly, everyone I know is not taking this lightly, we are all pretty concerned.&quot;</p> <p>Tomasi Macedru, who grew up in Fiji before moving to New Zealand as a youth, said he had lost phone contact with his village in Rakiraki, on Viti Levu's hard-hit north, about 2pm on Saturday as the storm intensified.</p> <p>&quot;Storm surges will be a huge problem tonight, as the village in on the side of Viti Levu Bay,&quot; he told <i>Stuff.</i></p> <p>&quot;I was a kid living there in 1972 when we last took a direct hit from Hurricane Bebe. That was frightening but this one is even bigger.&quot;</p> <p>Hurricane Bebe hit Fiji with winds of up to 280kmh, and killed five people in Tuvalu.</p> <p>New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) said 186 Kiwis had registered on its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.safetravel.govt.nz/\">SafeTravel</a>&nbsp;website as being in Fiji.

storm ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere on Saturday and early Sunday.</p> <p>One person is dead, and residents are under curfew as winds of up to 325kmh pummel the island nation.</p> <p>The Fiji Broadcasting Corporation (FBC) confirmed an elderly man of Nabasovi, Koro Island, became the first victim of Winston.</p> <p>DISMAC officer on duty, Vatia Vasuca, told FBC the man died after a

Email your photos and videos to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:newstips@stuff.co.nz\">newstips@stuff.co.nz</a></i></p> <hr /> <p>Winston, still a Category 5 system, is slowly moving away from Fiji. At 1am local time, it was located about 95km west-northwest of Nadi.</p> <p>Fiji Meteorology Office forecaster Amit Singh said the system was moving west at about 25kph and was expected to move in that direction for the next 12-18 hours before it takes the southeast turn, FBC reported.</p> <p>He said the worst was over for Fiji and winds easing in most places, although heavy rain remained.</p> <p>For western Viti Levu, the main island, the gale force wind warning currently in place was expected to ease in the next few hours, Singh said.</p> <p>However, rain would continue in the western division until early next week as the wind remains west-northwest, with flooding around Fiji becoming an issue.&nbsp;</p> <p>There were no reports on serious injury in Nausori, near Suva on Vitu Levu, but flooding, damage to houses and power poles had occurred in Savusavu, on Vanua Levu, while a bus was reported to have been washed inland by big tidal waves.</p> <p>After twice hammering outlying islands in nearby Tonga last week, Cyclone Winston re-intensified on Saturday and began to track west towards Suva, the capital of Fiji, packing winds of 230kmh, with gusts of up to 325kmh.</p> <p>The Fijian government has declared a state of natural disaster for the next 30 days.</p> <p>Hours before the storm hit land, Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama warned the nation is facing an ordeal &quot;of the most grievous kind&quot; as tropical Cyclone Winston begins to batter the country.</p> <p>He urged Fijians to prepare themselves for a &quot;terrible event&quot;.</p> <p>Forecasters were predicting that Nadi could take a direct hit from the cyclone in the next few hours.</p> <p>Fijian-born Lizann Vailasi was due to fly home to Sydney on Sunday.</p> <p>But instead she's hunkered down with her brother and his family at Pacific Harbour, south-west of Suva.</p> <p>She was mostly worried about her fellow Fijians sheltering in small towns as they wait for the worst of the wind and rain hit.</p> <p>&quot;There are thousands worse off. Fingers crossed and God willing.&quot;</p> <p>A number of airlines, including Air New Zealand, have stopped flying to Fiji until the weather clears.</p> <p><b>POWER OUTAGES ACROSS FIJI</b></p> <p>Fiji's Red Cross reported power outages across most of Fiji, including in the captial city of Suva.&nbsp;</p> <p>About 9.30pm, the eye of the cyclone made landfall over the north coast of Viti Levu, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported.</p> <p>The United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Winston was following a path that might spare Suva the full force of its winds, rated as category 5, the highest ranking on the hurricane wind scale.</p> <p>&quot;The cyclone has tracked further north than expected over the past 24 hours,&quot; the UN agency said.</p> <p>It was possible Suva may only be hit by 150kmh winds.</p> <p>Roads with trees and powerlines covering them are closed and the Fijian Government says they will not be cleared and water supplies will not be re-established until the storm passes.</p> <p><b>KIWIS ON THE GROUND</b></p> <p>New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) said 186 Kiwis had registered on its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.safetravel.govt.nz/\">SafeTravel</a>&nbsp;website as being in Fiji. It urged any Kiwis in the country to register on the website.</p> <p>However, as the cyclone made landfall shortly after 8.30pm, NZ time, New Zealanders in Fiji reported flickering electricity and outages to internet.&nbsp;</p> <p>Leanne Goff lives on Denarau Island and at 10pm said the cyclone was &quot;really picking up now&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;Even if I wanted to I wouldn't be able to stand up outside. Between the wind and the torrential rain it sounds like a freight train outside.&nbsp;Latest report is the eye is supposed to hit us 3am, which feels like very long time away. That's hours and hours of sustained battering.&quot;</p> <p>Tonight, the Hurricanes rugby team posted a message to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hurricanesrugby/?fref=ts\" target=\"_blank\">its Facebook page</a>, urging its Fijian supporters to stay safe.</p> <p>&quot;To all our friends from Fiji, the biggest ever storm ever in the Southern Hemisphere to looking you right in the eye. Please take cover and look after each other as this Cat 5 storm hits. From everyone at the Hurricanes and on behalf of NZ Kia kaha.&quot;</p> <p>The post has received hundreds of comments, many from those in Fiji sheltering from tropical cyclone Winston.</p> <p>&quot;Wind getting strong here in Nadi as well, and not feeling good knowing it's only gonna get worse,&quot; said Andrew Kang.</p> <p>Samy Lutumailagi posted &quot;We getting pounded right now. Neva seen this before. It's brutal man!&quot;</p> <p>Mark Wagner, a leadership coach visiting Fiji for a workshop, said winds were starting to pick up in Suva.</p> <p>&quot;[I have] never been in a cyclone before - this may not make sense but the wind actually sounds angry,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Arti Singh reported his family's neighbours in Suva had lost their roof as the wind gathered pace.&nbsp;</p> <p>Marijke Braaksma said her family, based in Nadi, had lost power.&nbsp;</p> <p>Caroline Gray said the noise at the Pearl Resort was deafening. &quot;I really feel for the locals, many of whom are spending the night in poorly constructed buildings.&quot;</p> <p>Tourists on the island of Naukacacuvu had to endure a rough three-hour ferry ride after being evacuated Saturday afternoon, but made it to Nadi before nightfall, and before Winston's full force hit.</p> <p><b>'STICK TOGETHER'</b></p> <p>The Fiji Met Service said the cyclone was expected to maintain its category five intensity - the most severe category of cyclone - as it tracked west over the centre of Fiji's main island of Viti Levu.</p> <p>The Island has a population of 650,000.&nbsp;</p> <p>Some Fijian towns had reportedly gone into virtual lock-down in preparation for the cyclone, and public transport had already been put on hold in many areas.&nbsp;</p> <p>Bainimarama urged locals to finalise their own preparations, to stick together and look after each other.</p> <p>&quot;As a nation, we are facing an ordeal of the most grievous kind.

Andrew Durante's own-goal gave Newcastle their first in the 27th.</p> <p>The loss came a day after Wellington, who sit second last on 19 points, had their future in the A-League assured for at least the next four years.</p> <p>Merrick, though, blasted his side's lacklustre effort before saying the news on Friday had not been a lift to him.</p> <p>&quot;It wasn't boost to me. I don't know how it affected the players,&quot; Merrick said.</p> <p>&quot;We knew all along they're not really going to have this league without a New Zealand team in there.</p> <p>&quot;What? They're going to be different from the netball, the rugby league and the rugby union. It's just a case of how, when and where, but by having it rubber-stamped, that's terrific. Now I can start re-signing existing players and signing some new players.</p> <p>&quot;I might get a couple of strikers with a bit of luck. I'll certainly get one and he'll probably get sent off in the first game, then injured ... It's been a horrendous year.&quot;</p> <p>Merrick believed his side had not coped with the heavy load of away games mid-season and said the run of home matches to finish was no consolation.</p> <p>&quot;I just love the people that say that,&quot; he said. &quot;You're second bottom in the league, but you've got lots of home games. Second bottom of the league ... the season's over for us. We're not making the finals, but you've got these home games - great.</p> <p>&quot;I've always got an eye on next season but I thought we could get away with a win today and scrape into the finals, but we're not looking very good for that.&quot;</p> <p>The eighth-placed Jets moved to 23 points and coach Scott Miller was pleased with the effort, which came after a 2-2 away draw with Brisbane and 2-1 home win over Melbourne City.</p> <p>&quot;I think it's the first time in two years we've had two home wins consecutively, so that's a nice little thing to bring to the club, but we certainly want more,&quot; Miller said.</p> <p>&quot;Next week is already on our minds and we want to win that game as well.&quot;</p>","images":[{"id":13976639,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T035419+1300","datetime_display":"03:54 21/02/2016","creditline":null,"caption":"Hamish

highs.","body":"<p>A rowdy group of French freedom campers have been embroiled in a scuffle with a New Zealand park ranger, leaving one tourist with bloody gashes to his head.</p> <p>Ranger Jarron McInnes spent seven years helping build the TECT All Terrain Park in the Bay of Plenty into one of the best facilities of its kind – a Mecca for trampers, mountain bikers, motocross riders, horse riders and target shooters.</p> <p>But his career came to an abrupt halt after the incident on January 12 when McInnes told the group, who were drinking alcohol late at night by the information centre near his ranger's home, to quieten down and move on.&nbsp;</p> <p>His 13-year-old son was with him at the time.</p> <p><b>READ MORE:<br /> <a

one of the campers ended up in Rotorua Hospital with two gashes on his head. McInnes, who said he was defending himself, was also at the centre of an internal investigation by his bosses and the Western Bay of Plenty District Council.</p> <p>McInnes said he had been advised not to comment, but the police report revealed two versions of events.</p> <p>According to the report, it appeared things turned nasty after McInnes picked up the campers' alcohol and tipped it out. One of them, David Le Prunennec, a Frenchman on a working holiday, became annoyed and confronted McInnes.</p> <p>McInnes claimed Le Prunennec grabbed him by the throat and pushed him to the ground. He said the others held him down while Le Prunennec jumped on top of him and assaulted him.</p> <p>He said he struck Le Prunennec on the head a couple of times with his flashlight to get him off. McInnes, who is Maori, said a racial insult was also hurled.</p> <p>Le Prunennec claimed the assault with the torch was unprovoked, and he retaliated by hitting McInnes before they scuffled on the ground.</p> <p>Pictures on the police file show Le Prunennec with blood coming from two wounds on his head. McInnes was not injured.</p> <p>Neither party wanted to press charges and Le Prunennec left the country soon after. He could not be reached for comment.</p> <p>Police were unable to determine who was the aggressor and both men were described in the file at various points as victims.</p> <p>&quot;The stories are mixed, however there was no way of substantiating either story,&quot; the investigating officer wrote.</p> <p>But McInnes struck the raw end of the deal - he was sacked for &quot;breaching protocol&quot; by venturing out at night and for injuring a park visitor. He was given a couple of weeks to vacate the ranger's house.</p> <p>&quot;I was going to be here until the day I retire. I built this park with my own bare hands more or less, with the help of a lot of people, and I just think it's disgusting the way they've treated me,&quot; he said.</p> <p>The decision to sack McInnes has sparked a backlash from park users, who described the treatment as &quot;disgraceful&quot;.</p> <p>Someone wrote on Facebook: &quot;What a bunch of gutless pricks we have in our council ... you should be ashamed. Jarron has put his own safety on the line time and time again only to be hung out to dry when he should have had the support of our council.&quot;</p> <p>Another person put a sign on the window of the council's headquarters in Tauranga demanding the council &quot;do the right thing&quot; by reinstating McInnes and starting an independent inquiry.</p> <p>McInnes, a rural firefighter who last year travelled to Alberta, Canada to help fight massive wildfires, hired a lawyer in his fight to be reinstated.</p> <p>The council said in a statement it wouldn't go into detail publicly, other than to say it stood by its decision to dismiss McInnes and it had conducted a &quot;thorough, robust and fair&quot; investigation.</p> <p>Murray Guy, a former Tauranga City Councillor and member of the park's management committee, said there had never been any issues with McInnes' performance and he'd never even received a warning. &quot;You don't terminate someone's employment effectively because he's protected himself and his family,&quot; said Guy.</p> <p>He believed the council had failed in its obligations to an employee by not providing him with effective communications in a remote location, 30km from the nearest police or ambulance, and by accepting freedom campers - sometimes dozens a night - without a proper registration process or facilities.</p> <p>Guy was appalled that McInnes had been accused of breaching protocol by going out at night.</p> <p>&quot;On numerous occasions Jarron presented reports to us which included his night-time after hours activities, checking out boy racers, checking out headlights, gunshots...he felt that was part of his obligation,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Guy said McInnes mistakenly believed it was an alcohol-free zone and it was remiss of the council not to have made it such.</p> <p>The council said it took care to ensure the safety of all its staff, including those who worked in remote locations.</p> <p>Rangers were provided with RT radios which were connected to a number of support networks.</p> <p>Western Bay mayor Ross Paterson declined to comment, saying it was a staff matter.</p>

advocate for the baby known as &quot;Asha&quot; and her family, said she was worried the one-year-old's removal could be imminent.</p> <p>The Darwin Asylum Seeker Support&nbsp;and Advocacy Network advocacy coordinator said Serco guards had blocked all calls to their room at Brisbane's Lady Cilento Hospital and&nbsp;immigration officers had warned the baby would be moved on Saturday.</p> <p>However, a&nbsp;Children's Health Queensland spokesman said there had been no change to baby Asha's position.</p> <p>The Department of Immigration and Border Protection has been contacted for comment.</p> <p>It is understood that doctors inside the hospital have discussed moving Asha to avoid Serco staff.&nbsp;</p> <p>An estimated crowd of more than 300 protesters was warned to remain calm if baby Asha emerged.</p> <p>The crowd split into three groups to guard all exits from the hospital.</p> <p>Horns were honking in support almost non-stop as cars passed through the busy intersection outside the hospital.</p> <p>Ms Blucher&nbsp;said a hospital doctor had assured the family she wouldn't be going anywhere but the combination of factors was &quot;concerning&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;I deal with a lot of transfers between detention centres and offshore, it's always the practice to remove the person from the compound normally and then hold them incommunicado,&quot; she said.</p> <p>&quot;So they're not allowed to call their lawyers, their lawyers aren't allowed to call them.</p> <p>&quot;They're not allowed to call their support people or tell any friends where they are, and then they get transferred after that.</p> <p>&quot;My concern is because they're holding her incommunicado, it could be part of that transfer process but it could also be just to deny her the right to speak to people who are providing support to her.&quot;</p> <p>Supporter numbers at a nine-day vigil outside the hospital swelled quickly as rumours spread about Asha's impending removal on Saturday afternoon.</p> <p>On Thursday, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton warned he would not be &quot;pressured&quot; over the issue.</p> <p>&quot;If people have received medical assistance and the &shy;assistance is no longer required, if they've recovered from their medical condition, then they'll be returned to Nauru,&quot; he told 4BC radio.</p> <p>Human Rights Law Centre lawyers earlier in the week announced they'd received an undertaking a 72-hour warning would be given before Asha was moved, even as they raised fears the government was planning to revoke the warning period for 266

The report highlights new statistics from the Health Ministry showing that one in three Kiwi kids is overweight or obese.</p> <p>In recent years, there have been numerous major projects nationwide to promote walking, biking and taking scooters to school, recognising that activity is healthy.</p> <p>One success story is a New Zealand Transport Agency initiative..&nbsp;In 2010, it picked New Plymouth and Hastings as its two walking and cycling model communities, investing $6.5 million into each city to encourage more activity, &nbsp;, particularly among school kids. The cities' local authorities also contributed millions more towards the projects.</p> <p>Model communities were a test to see if investment topromote riding and walk would pay dividends, says its national cycling manager, Dougal List.</p> <p>Research in New Plymouth has found the numbers of kids dropped off by car at the school gate has halved and the numbers walking, cycling and using scooters has swiftly risen. About a quarter are dropped at its new 'park and ride' zones, about 500m to 1km from school, and walk or cycle the rest of the way.</p> <p>&quot;We are still not there yet, though through the model community funding, we are tracking in the right direction,&quot; New Plymouth District Council's coordinator of &nbsp;integrated transportation, Liz Beck, says.</p> <p>It uses a two-pronged approach of investing in infrastructure changes, such as new cycleways and walkways, plus working with schools to educate and encourage students to use active transport. This includes courses on cycling and scooter skills. </p> <p>The council has also reduced driving speeds around many schools to 40kmh at peak times, &nbsp;and some roads in the central business district have a 30kmh speed limit.</p> <p>Proven benefits from model communities is partly behind the $333m Urban Cycle Programme, which was rolled out nationwide in mid-2015 and includes nearly $89m for Auckland projects, List says.</p> <p>By 2018, there will be 54 new cycleways in urban areas around New Zealand, funded by local and national government. About half are shared pathways for pedestrians and many focus on links with schools to get kids active.</p> <p>The $7m Future Streets Te Ara Mua project, a year-long project to transform the Mangere community in South Auckland, aims to improve safety&nbsp; for pedestrians and cyclists, particularly school kids.</p> <p>Jointly funded by the NZTA, Auckland Transport and the Mangere-Otahuhu Local Board, the project includes reducing speed limits, introducing new cycleways, better pedestrian crossings and modifying streets to improve&nbsp;traffic behaviour. The first sod was turned last November and work started in earnest in January.</p> <p>Mangere was picked because it ranked fourth out of 275 Auckland communities for fatal and serious crashes, &nbsp;and more than a quarter of them involved pedestrians. </p> <p>Board chairwoman Lydia Sosene is confident the initiative will increase the numbers of schoolkids walking, cycling and using scooters.</p> <p>&quot;If we want our community to choose healthy options, we have got to fund changes to infrastructure and show leadership for this issue,&quot; she says.</p> <p>&quot;Drivers really believe they own the road and don't want to share it. It's about making drivers aware that roads are a shared space.&quot;</p> <p>Sosene and many others involved with road safety echo the World Health Organisation's call for 30kmh speeds near schools and residential communities.</p> <p>Safekids Aotearoa, set up in the early 1990s by Auckland's Starship hospital to reduce preventable injuries to children, believes New Zealand needs legislation reducing&nbsp;speed limits near all schools to 30kmh.</p> <p>&quot;At the moment, drivers are confused about what speeds they should go past schools,&quot; director Ann Weaver says.</p> <p>&quot;Let's make it consistent around all school that 30kmh is the speed limit.&quot;</p> <p>Variable speed zones of 40kmh near schools were first trialled in 2000 in Christchurch. Nationwide, such slower speed zones are initiated by schools or roading authorities on an ad hoc basis and must comply with NZTA criteria and local authority by-laws. </p> <p>Weaver says traffic risks are a key concern for parents letting their children walking and cycling.</p> <p>Safekids released a report in December 2015 about child unintentional deaths and injuries, which calls for a range of measures to make the roads safer for children. It highlights studies in the United Kingdom, which found child pedestrian deaths dropped by 70 per cent because of cutting speed limits in many urban roads in London to 20mph, which equals 32kph.</p> <p>It notes that a pedestrian hit by a car travelling at 30kmh&nbsp;has more than a 90 per cent chance of surviving compared to only a 50 per cent chance if hit at 45kmh.</p> <p>Canterbury mother-of-two Lucinda Rees agrees the 30kmh goal is essential.</p> <p>Her fears prompted her to start NZ School Speeds seven years ago to lobby for a mandatory 30kmh speed limit near schools nationwide.</p> <p>&quot;It's the bit outside the school that children are most endangered.&quot;</p> <p>At the time, her kids attended Swannanoa School, a rural primary near Christchurch in a 100kmh speed zone. Her lobbying helped to cut the speed limit to 60kmh past the school.</p> <p>However, she says it is ironic that New Zealand drivers must slow to 20kmh to pass school buses and &nbsp;around road workers, but no such &nbsp;protection exists &nbsp;for students.</p> <p>&quot;Once we have 30kmh outside all schools, people will get used to slowing down near them.&quot;</p> <p>The move is backed by road safety charity Brake.</p> <p>&quot;We believe it's really important that children are able to get out in their communities and walk and cycle to school,&quot; says its New Zealand director, Caroline Perry.</p> <p>It has found a key barrier to children cycling and walking to schools is parental fears about unsafe roads.</p> <p>Several yet-to-be-published studies on students in Auckland, Wellington and Dunedin are looking at school transport issues.</p> <p>Otago University's Built Environment and Active Transport to School study aims to survey parents about their children's transport choices.</p> <p>It has found only a quarter of surveyed students from 12 Dunedin high schools walked or cycled to school during the past two years, with only a tiny number cycling, compared to 60 per cent using motorised transport and the rest using a mixture of active and motorised means.</p> <p>The students cited safety as a key concern, but raised other barriers such as the weight of school bags, getting hot and sweaty,&nbsp;and the inconvenience of managing after-school commitments.</p> <p>The study's results also revealed some surprises, showing the complexity of the issue, says its principal investigator, Dr Sandra Mandic.</p> <p>Half of the students surveyed said they were too lazy to walk or cycle to school, despite living less than 4km away.</p> <p>&quot;If they can't be bothered, we have to think about what are we doing for interventions.&quot;</p> <p>For some, it is unlikely they will ever again walk to school.&nbsp;</p> <p>Little Daejon Pahia isn't scared – but his family is.</p> <p>After the accident in Takanini, grandfather Matthew Ngatai now says &nbsp;it is too dangerous for children to walk alone to school</p> <p>When Ngatai's children were young, they always walked to and from school – but not his grandchildren. Daejon's parents won't let them.</p> <p>Ngatai says: &quot;They've become more protective.&quot;</p> <p><b>THE SUNDAY STAR-TIMES SAYS:</b></p> <ul> <li><i><b>Families:</b>&nbsp;Choose one day a week

Also, what was with that word &quot;dope&quot;?</p> <p>Dotcom is a white, wealthy 42-year-old businessman who has made his money in IT. For him to use the word &quot;dope&quot; sounded off-key, a bit naff. It reminded me of the occasion when ACT leader David Seymour claimed, with an invisible wink, that he was looking forward to a summer of &quot;Netflix and chill&quot; (which is cool-kids-speak for having sex while watching TV). It felt like when Hillary Clinton last year tweeted: &quot;How does your student loan debt make you feel? Tell us in 3 emojis or less.&quot; It felt like your uncle crumping at a wedding.</p> <p><b>READ MORE<br /> * <a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/77015803/asb-invites-loyal-customer-to-netflix-and-chill.html\" target=\"_blank\">ASB makes indecent proposal to customer<br /> </a><a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/76970548/dotcom-gives-max-key-radio-debut-the-big-thumbs-up\" target=\"_blank\">* Dotcom gives Max Key debut thumbs-up<br /> </a><a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/77014241/christchurch-radio-station-bans-max-key-single\" target=\"_blank\">* Radio station 'bans' Max Key single<br /> </a><a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/home-property/76971592/take-a-cheeky-video-tour-of-kim-dotcoms-old-coatesville-mansion\" target=\"_blank\">* Take a tour of Dotcom's mansion</a></b></p> <p>Yet I couldn't quite put my finger on why Dotcom's &quot;dope&quot; was bothering me, so I asked Kevin Watson, senior lecturer in linguistics at the University of Canterbury, for help.</p> <p>New words turn up all the time, says Watson, often from a small subgroup of the population. Some words remain only within the group that coined them but others spread till everyone says them. They're most likely to be noticed – and pilloried – when they're somewhere inbetween: &quot;it has to be frequent enough to be spotted, but not so frequent or widely used that everybody does it&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;Cool&quot;, for instance, has been around as a term of approval since the 1890s according to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, which is why people of almost any age can use it without anyone cringing. &quot;Dope&quot; as a term of praise, however, first appears in the OED only in 1981, and it has remained relatively specialised, says Watson – associated especially with hip-hop.</p> <p>Fairfax columnist Grant Smithies &nbsp;is an authority on music, so I rang him for further advice.</p> <p>Dotcom's use of &quot;dope&quot;, says Smithies, is definitely &quot;very comical&quot;, but it's complicated by the fact that Dotcom is a man who has released his own dance record, which he quite possibly also considered &quot;dope&quot;. In fact, says Smithies, Dotcom's own music is &nbsp;&quot;hideous on the ears&quot;, suggesting his musical taste is not to be trusted.</p> <p>That aside, Smithies says there is a rich tradition of language originating in a black American musical subculture, then filtering out to the wider world, even if you don't hear the words hip, cat, or daddy-o all that often nowadays.</p> <p>&quot;This is the way we roll&quot; was still vaguely &quot;street&quot; when it was the title of a 1991 MC Hammer song, but 25 years on it's been softened out and ironised to the point where you might hear this sort of conversation in a &nbsp;suburban middle-class household: &quot;Have you filled up the dishwasher?&quot; &quot;No, we're going to leave it till after dinner, 'cos that's how we roll&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;Or 'bling',&quot; says Smithies. &quot;Ten years ago it was just a black American thing and now probably even Michael Hill uses it.&quot;</p> <p>The music world's full of people who overdo the appropriation of language, says Smithies, &quot;and the funniest people are the ones who do it without irony, and think that by lifting it wholesale it makes them more interesting&quot;.</p> <p>There's a music-biz guy Smithies knows whose vocabulary seems to be replenished every few weeks.</p> <p>&quot;For a while he was constantly saying 'shot' –&nbsp; 'Shot bro! Shot!'. Then the next time you'd see him it would be expunged and replaced with something else.&quot;</p> <p>Smithies recommends keeping your ears open at those winery gigs.</p> <p>&quot;You can't go to a winery concert event without hearing something that's from the depth of Queens rolled out in a non-ironic way by some affluent middle-class character.&quot;</p> <p>It can make you wince, says Smithies, but it's harmless really. People are insecure and they want to fit in, and language is a big part of doing that. Middle-aged white New Zealanders talk like they're black American rappers. In the UK you get public-school rich kids dropping their aitches to sound more Cockney. Black culture and working-class culture are seen as cooler – and people want to be cool.</p> <p>Fitting in isn't the only incentive. There's also money in appearing to be cool. Giant brands such as Coke still spend heavily on mainstream advertising aimed at young people, but the internet has changed the game. &nbsp;</p> <p>Now, brands are using social media to communicate directly with their customers in something resembling their own language, and the results aren't always pretty.</p> <p>There's a fabulous Twitter account I've just discovered, Brands Saying Bae, which collects egregious examples of companies trying to get down with the kids and failing. (&quot;Bae&quot;, meaning girlfriend/boyfriend/significant other, popped up in rap songs in the mid-2000s and, according to an article in <i>The Atlantic</i>, went &quot;mainstream&quot; in 2014. It has since been cringe-makingly used in the social media communications of companies including Wal-Mart, Pizza Hut, Mountain Dew and Burger King).</p> <p>Thus the @BrandsSayingBae account invites you to sneer at the tweet Pizza Hut sent to Kanye West containing a wacky parody of his forthcoming album cover. You will learn that the fast-food chain Denny's used a team of consultants to finesse its response to Jay Z's birthday and see a photo of a garage advertising its lube services with a sign saying &quot;YOLO, YOUR OIL LIGHT'S ON. IT'S LIT FAM&quot;. Apart from &quot;yolo&quot; (you only live once), I have no idea what any of that means.</p> <p>One of the most popular @BrandsSayingBae posts, though, is a screengrab of an exchange between a New Zealand woman and her bank.</p> <p>As reported today, Auckland legal services worker Grace Hall, 24, tweeted her thanks to the official ASB Twitter account after one of its staff helped her. @ASBBank replied cheerily and they sort of flirted back and forth until the bank, founded in 1847, replied: &quot;Netflix and chill 4eva? Or are we moving too fast?&quot;</p> <p>ASB says the young staff member running the account hadn't realised the sexual double-meaning of &quot;Netflix and chill&quot;, but the rest of the internet did. Brands Saying Bae captioned the exchange: &quot;What to look for in a bank: - Mobile Deposit - No ATM Fees - Wants to F... me&quot;. The UK's <i>Sun </i>newspaper then ran the story under a heading &quot;New Zealand based bank makes indecent proposal to loyal account holder on Twitter&quot;.</p> <p>In this case no jobs were lost and no serious harm was done, but Hall says she felt embarrassed on behalf of a bank that had tried, and failed, to be cool.</p> <p>Jon Randles of Auckland social media marketing company Mosh agrees it's easy to mess up, and once a brand joins social media, the most important thing is authenticity.</p> <p>&quot;If you're an old white guy trying to be a cool young brand you're going to be found out. And then if you do hire young people to be that kind of cool person for you, you start to put your larger brand at risk, as in the case of this Netflix and chill person.&quot;</p> <p>Randles is in his late 30s, and works in an office of people in their mid-20s. So yes, he does find himself trying out words that arguably are too young for him, but he reckons irony gives him some latitude.</p> <p>The latest buzzword he's noticed is the deliberate misuse of &quot;literally&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;I'll say – 'I'm literally going to die'.&quot;</p> <p>Of course, a major bank propositioning its customer wasn't our first &quot;Netflix and chill&quot; scandal. Seymour </p> <p>admits he was fully aware of the term's meaning –&nbsp; &quot;Sometimes I like to troll the uptight in the community.&quot;</p> <p>He wasn't, though, trying to be cool.</p> <p>He's 32, which isn't an unreasonable age to know about and talk about &quot;Netflix and chill&quot;, and he'd &nbsp;never use words that didn't feel natural to him. You can say just about anything if you're being authentic, but when you're not people can tell, and can even take offence.</p> <p>He wouldn't use the word &quot;dope&quot;. &quot;Bae&quot;, too, seems too young and recent for him to risk.</p> <p>&quot;Chur&quot;, though, he would use, because that was still current when he was at school.</p> <p>Perhaps I was wrong to get my knickers in a twist about the language Dotcom uses. It's a free country. He's a free man for now. He can use whatever words he wants.</p> <p>The problem with borrowing words badly, Smithies reckons, is the risk of embarrassment from what appears to be attempts to wear the colours of someone else's culture,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;and you start to think 'who are you'?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;But unless someone is showing other strong signs of being a wanker, I find it mildly endearing. They're trying to add a bit of flavour to their language.&quot;</p> <p>To which sentiment you might respond (but I won't, seeing I'm a middle-class suburban Pakeha male not closely affiliated with the popular music world): Word!</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeFM\">@GeorgeFM</a> I&#39;m cruisin in my G right now.

Melbourne mixed things up well, made their shots through those first three quarters and had a shot at taking the series back to Hisense.</p> <p>But in the end the playoff kings of this league showed once again why Melbourne coach Dean Demopoulos admires them so much. &quot;They're better than us right now, but we aspire to be like them,&quot; he said afterwards.</p> <p>The Breakers are on some sort of a post-season roll. This is their fifth consecutive series sweep, and they have now extended their record consecutive playoff game win streak to 11 (stretching back to 2012). They have also now won a record nine straight post-season series, beating the mark they shared with the Sydney Kings of 2003-06.</p> <p>They will almost certainly resume hostilities with their great rivals, the Perth Wildcats, who are 1-0 up on Illawarra, with Hawks star and league MVP Kevin Lisch out for the playoffs with an ankle injury.</p> <p>&quot;I'm just so pleased we were able to get over the hump and find this form at the right time of the season,&quot; said departing Breakers coach Dean Vickerman. &quot;We only found it just at the right time. But this group, in big moments, in big games, they just go to another level.</p> <p>&quot;We saw that in the second half tonight. There were some big moments that needed to happen, and Ced, Tai and Tommy, a lot of people, made big plays for us tonight. A lot of that you can't coach.&quot;</p> <p>Abercrombie delivered his usual high-class dose of playoff hoops with that 23 points on nine-of-15 shooting, including four of six from beyond the arc. Two of those triples came in the final term, and along with a couple from Jackson were like daggers to the Melbourne side's heart.</p> <p>Wesley showed up to play big time, seeming to enjoy some verbal sparring with his highly credentialed opposite Hakim Warrick and thriving as the Breakers' go-to guy in the low post. He had 16 points (6/10 FG), six boards and a pair of blocks.</p> <p>Of course Cedric Jackson was not to be denied, the stat-stuffing point guard finishing with 19 points, eight rebounds, five assists and two steals to keep alive his perfect record in playoff hoops with the Breakers. Corey Webster added a quiet 13 points for the victors alongside four rebounds and five assists, while Alex Pledger (eight points, five boards) and Mika Vukona (seven points, nine rebounds) did their bit.</p> <p>Melbourne got 23 points from Chris Goulding and solid efforts from Warrick (17 points, six rebounds) and Daniel Kickert (16 points) but when the game went on the line just couldn't go with the side their coach acknowledges as the best in this league.</p> <p>United sprung a surprise by going small ball from the tip, bringing the undersized Owen Odigie in to play at power forward, and it appeared to unsettle the Breakers in the early going.</p> <p>But they steadied the ship to work into the lead late in the quarter and behind three-pointers from Abercrombie and Reuben Te Rangi took a 23-17 advantage into the first break.</p> <p>The lead extended to nine when Tai Wesley and Cedric Jackson knocked down consecutive triples round the mid-point of the second quarter, but was erased when the visitors went on a 12-0 run as the Breakers got careless with the ball, and paid the price.</p> <p>With Goulding and Warrick continuing to score freely (28 first-half points between them), United worked into a 46-41 lead at the half, with the most telling stat their 16 points (to just two) off 10 Breakers turnovers.</p> <p>Sure enough, the Breakers tidied up their game (they had just two turnovers in the entire second half) and back they climbed into it, some nice interior work from Wesley and some excellent energy by Shea Ili off the bench giving the home side a slender 58-57 lead at the final break.</p> <p>From there it was all about who held their poise best. That was very much the Breakers as they weathered an early storm of back-to-back Goulding triples and took control as Abercrombie, Wesley and Jackson took their turns at big shot making.</p> <p>&quot;They (Melbourne) were a different team tonight and had a different edge about them,&quot; added Vickerman. &quot;But those two (Jackson and Abercrombie) were absolutely massive. Tommy, in the game over there, really wanted the basketball at different stages and tonight you could just see there was an absolute confidence he was going to make plays.&quot;</p> <p>The grand final is scheduled to get under way on March 2, but may be brought forward, depending on what happens in the other series which could wrap up as early as Sunday.</p> <p><b>NZ Breakers 91</b> (Tom Abercrombie 23, Cedric Jackson 19, Tai Wesley 16, Corey Webster 13)&nbsp;<b>Melbourne United 78</b> (Chris Goulding 23, Hakim Warrick 17, Daniel Kickert 16, Stephen Holt 12). 1Q: 23-17; HT: 41-46; 3Q: 58-57.</p> <p><b>NZ Breakers win the ANBL semifinal series 2-0</b></p>","images":[{"id":13976479,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T013517+1300","datetime_display":"01:35 21/02/2016","creditline":null,"caption":"Tai Wesley","variants":[{"id":13976479,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455971717/479/13976479.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"60"}]},{"id":13976480,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T013517+1300","datetime_display":"01:35 21/02/2016","creditline":"ANTHONY AU-YEUNG/PHOTOSPORT","source_code":"sunday-star-times","source_name":"Sunday Star Times","caption":"Charles Jackson of the Breakers throws down a dunk in their series-clinching win.","variants":[{"id":13976480,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455971717/480/13976480.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"60"}]},{"id":13976481,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T013517+1300","datetime_display":"01:35 21/02/2016","creditline":"ANTHONY AU-YEUNG/PHOTOSPORT","source_code":"sunday-star-times","source_name":"Sunday Star Times","caption":"Charles Jackson of the Breakers throws down a dunk in their series-clinching win.","variants":[{"id":13976481,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455971717/481/13976481.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"620","height":"349"}]},{"id":13976482,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T013517+1300","datetime_display":"01:35 21/02/2016","creditline":"ANTHONY AU-YEUNG/PHOTOSPORT","source_code":"sunday-star-times","source_name":"Sunday Star Times","caption":"Charles Jackson of the Breakers throws down a dunk in their series-clinching win.","variants":[{"id":13976482,"layout":"Strap Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455971717/482/13976482.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"300","height":"200"}]},{"id":13976484,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T013517+1300","datetime_display":"01:35 21/02/2016","creditline":"ANTHONY AU-YEUNG/PHOTOSPORT","source_code":"sunday-star-times","source_name":"Sunday Star Times","caption":"Charles Jackson of the Breakers throws down a dunk in their series-clinching win.","variants":[{"id":13976484,"layout":"Defcon Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455971717/484/13976484.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"418","height":"220"}]},{"id":13976485,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T013517+1300","datetime_display":"01:35 21/02/2016","creditline":"ANTHONY AU-YEUNG/PHOTOSPORT","source_code":"sunday-star-times","source_name":"Sunday Star Times","caption":"Charles Jackson of the Breakers throws down a dunk in their series-clinching win.","variants":[{"id":13976485,"layout":"ipad section splash 956:956","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455971717/485/13976485.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"956","height":"956"}]}],"videos":[{"id":13976477,"layout":"Standard Video","datetime_iso8601":"20160221T013503+1300","datetime_display":"01:35 21/02/2016","creditline":null,"caption":"NZ Breakers, with Cedric Jackson again a standout, book their ticket to another ANBL finals series with a 91-78 win over Melbourne United.","src":"https://assets.stuff.co.nz/video/production/1455970769340-3910869709001_4765413895001_4765397064001.mp4","video_poster":{"id":13976486,"layout":"Video Image","src":"http://file2.stuff.co.nz/1456005551/486/13976486.jpg","width":"620","height":"348"}}]},{"id":77104288,"path":"/auckland/77104288/Chaos-at-Auckland-Lantern-Festival","url":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/_json/auckland/77104288/Chaos-at-Auckland-Lantern-Festival","section":"Stuff","section-home":"Auckland","section-top-level":"Auckland","layout":"landscape-image","title":"'Chaos' at Auckland Lantern Festival","subhead":null,"alt_headline":"'Chaos' at Lantern Festival","datetime_iso8601":"20160220T223857+1300","datetime_display":"22:38 20/02/2016","byline":null,"source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","intro":"Two people were arrested for assault at a family friendly Auckland festival which has been labelled \"a disaster\" by one spectator.","alt_intro":"Two people arrested for assault at the Auckland Lantern Festival as \"disorder creeps in\".","body":"<p>Two people were arrested for assault at a family friendly Auckland festival which has been labelled &quot;a disaster&quot; by one spectator.</p> <p>This is the first year the Auckland Lantern Festival was held at the city's Domain - but even the vast lawns could not hold the crowd.</p> <p>&quot;It is a disaster.

In the exchange of jokey tweets that followed, the bank asked &quot;Netflix and chill 4eva? Or are we moving to fast ?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Netflix and chill&quot; is widely understood to mean watching TV while having sex, but an ASB spokesman said the social media staffer operating the Twitter account didn't realise the phrase had a sexual double-meaning.</p> <p><b>READ MORE:<br /> * <a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/77075746/why-you-probably-dont-sound-as-cool-as-you-think.html\" target=\"_blank\">Why you probably don't sound as cool as you think</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/opinion/75689625/seymours-desire-to-netflix-and-chill--endearingly-gaffeprone-or-totally-self-aware\" target=\"_blank\">* Was Seymour's 'Netflix and chill' gaffe really a gaffe?<br /> </a><a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/77075746/why-you-probably-dont-sound-as-cool-as-you-think.html\" target=\"_blank\">* How to make a dope of yourself by trying to be cool</a></b></p> <p>The bank later deleted its tweets, but not before they had been screen-grabbed and reposted by a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrandsSayingBae/status/689090198748164096\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter account</a> that collects examples of corporate social-media embarrassments. </p> <p>The staffer, Alex Spence, declined to comment on Saturday.</p> <p>But Hall, 24, said she found the exchange, which took place in January, &quot;pretty hilarious&quot;.</p> <p>She hasn't made a complaint to the bank: &quot;It didn't bring me any offence. It didn't hurt me in any way.&quot;</p> <p>She said she had felt embarrassed on the bank's behalf for having tried to be cool and failed, and at first assumed the tweet had been written by an older staff member who didn't realise what they were saying.</p> <p>&quot;Whoever manages them wouldn't have been too happy about it. I felt they would have copped enough flak from the people who'd seen it.&quot;</p> <p>Later she did a little cyber-sleuthing and realised the staff member was a man around her own age, which made her think it was more likely he'd known the double-meaning. &nbsp;</p> <p>ASB spokesman Christian May said on Friday that there had been no change in policy or guidelines for staff, as this was &quot;a genuine mistake&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;We encourage healthy dialogue between people on our social media accounts, and it's just a timely reminder to be conscious of what you're writing. These are humans manning the Twitter account, and occasionally these things happen. There was no malice.&quot;</p> <p>He said no apology had been sought by, or made to, Hall. &quot;We just took it down and left it at that.&quot;</p> <p>May also forwarded a link to a <a href=\"http://www.dailyedge.ie/netflix-and-chill-2-2537786-Jan2016/\" target=\"_blank\">website listing numerous other instances</a> where companies and media organisations had innocently misused the phrase &quot;Netflix and chill&quot;.</p> <p>Jon Randles of Mosh Social Media Marketing in Auckland said the gaffe was a good example of the dangers large brands face when trying to use social media to engage more directly with customers, especially younger, internet-savvy ones.</p> <p>He said social media users are wary of Twitter or Facebook accounts that feel like they're run by &quot;an old white guy trying to be cool&quot; so businesses often hire younger staff to run them. Those inexperienced youngsters can then sometimes &quot;start to put your larger brand at risk&quot;.</p> <p>Act leader David Seymour, who provoked a storm in a teacup last month by telling a reporter he planned to &quot;Netflix and chill&quot; over the summer, said the staffer's only crime was that he was &quot;lacking a bit of style – and most people I know have been guilty of that at some time or other&quot;.</p> ","images":[{"id":13977895,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T091716+1300","datetime_display":"09:17 21/02/2016","creditline":"LOUIE DOUVIS/FAIRFAX MEDIA","source_code":"fairfax-media","source_name":"Fairfax Media","caption":"Netflix and chill?

It turns out there's a lot of them. And the parents aren't who I imagined. Democrats and Republicans. Muslims and Catholics. Grandparents raising grandkids. Yes, there's a lesbian or two in the mix, but even they are baffled about how this happened. All these parents were scared and confused at first.</p> <p>I also talked to my pediatrician and read national psychological and medical associations' positions. If my child was having mental-health problems, I wanted to help.</p> <p>They all agreed: I need to let her be herself. If I love and support her, as a girl, she'll be happy and healthy. But if I try to force her to be a boy, she would be in a very high suicide risk category.</p> <p>So when confronted with trusting her heart and mind, or trusting her genitals, I choose her heart and mind. There was no rational choice other than to support her as a girl.</p> <p>And, of course, I want her safe from predators. I learned that transgender people are at extreme risk for sexual and physical violence. The Southern Poverty Law Centre recently declared transgender women the most victimised group in the nation. Victims, not predators.</p> <p>Examples of a transgender person, or a man pretending to be transgender, assaulting someone in a bathroom are rare. The Human Rights Campaign and the American Civil Liberties Union have pointed out that there are no documented cases in the United States.</p> <p>I have a 6-year-old. The proposed laws would require her to use the men's room. The scenario they're drumming up fear with - impersonators or actual transgender women assaulting women in bathrooms - is conjecture at best.</p> <p>These proposed bathroom restrictions make little sense. For starters, transgender people live among us and currently pee. They aren't hurting anyone.</p> <p>And consider that while some transgender people may appear transgender, many don't - for example models Geena Rocero or Ben Melzer. So, when transgender people use the restroom consistent with their identity, people who look like women use the women's room. But if we require genital-based restrictions, we would be sending transgender men, with beards and biceps, into the women's restroom.</p> <p>So, if a man eventually does decide to assault women by being deceptive about gender identity, genital-based restroom laws would ironically make it easier for him. If transgender women use the women's restroom, he would have to dress up like a woman to enter. Under the proposed system, all he has to do is claim he's a transgender man to walk into the women's restroom.

The filing was first reported by the Dutch magazine Quote.</p> <p class=\"indent\">The revelation comes as Google faces outrage in Europe over the small amount of tax it pays in the region. Last month, after Google reached a controversial 130 million pound (NZ$205 billion) settlement with the UK government over an audit covering 10 years of accounts, critics called the amount &quot;derisory.&quot;</p> <p class=\"indent\">The deal spawned parliamentary hearings, a government audit and scrutiny from the European Union. France and Italy are also reportedly in discussions with Google to settle ongoing tax disputes.</p> <p class=\"indent\">&nbsp;</p> <p class=\"indent\"><b>READ MORE:<br /> *&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/world/76187802/google-paid-apple-us1-billion-to-keep-search-bar-on-iphone\" target=\"_blank\">Google paid Apple US$1 billion to keep search bar on iPhone<br /> </a>*&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/digital-living/75986602/google-is-trying-to-kill-passwords\">Google is trying to kill passwords<br /> *</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/world/71008994/Google-to-become-Alphabet-Inc-in-shakeup\">Google&nbsp;to become Alphabet</a></b></p> <div class=\"fb-follow\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stuff.co.nz\" data-layout=\"standard\" data-show-faces=\"false\"> &nbsp; </div> <p class=\"indent\">Outside of Europe, legislators in Australia have in recent weeks questioned whether the company is paying a fair share of tax there.</p> <p class=\"indent\">&quot;Google complies with the tax laws in every country where we operate,&quot; the company said in an e-mailed statement.</p> <p class=\"center\"><b>DUTCH SANDWICH</b></p> <p class=\"indent\">Google's Dutch subsidiary is the heart of tax structures known as a &quot;Double Irish&quot; and a &quot;Dutch Sandwich&quot; because it involves moving money from one Google subsidiary in Ireland to a Google subsidiary in the Netherlands before moving it out again to a different Irish subsidiary, physically based in Bermuda, where there is no corporate income tax.</p> <p class=\"indent\">This movement of cash enables Google parent Alphabet to keep the effective tax rate on its international income in the single digits.</p> <p class=\"indent\">For 2015, Alphabet reported its average tax rate outside the US was just 6.3 percent, according to a calculation using the income from foreign operations and the foreign income tax reported in its US Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Figures for 2015 revenue moved through Google's Dutch subsidiary aren't available.</p> <p class=\"center\"><b>TAX STRUCTURE</b></p> <p class=\"indent\">The company says this calculation does not reflect the methods actually used to determine its international taxes in any jurisdiction. Those methods involve transfer pricing, where payments between various international subsidiaries are used to attribute profit to the geographies where economic value is deemed to have been created.</p> <p class=\"indent\">The amount of these payments are based on estimates of what similar transactions with an unrelated company would cost. Google attributes most of the economic value of its products to its research and development operations in the US and, in the case of its overseas sales, to its Bermuda-based subsidiary, which holds the international licenses for Google's intellectual property.</p> <p class=\"indent\">The Irish tax loophole that makes the &quot;Double Irish&quot; possible was closed by the Irish parliament last year. But companies already using the structure can continue to employ it until the end of 2020.</p> <p class=\"indent\">Last week, Tom Hutchinson, Google's vice president for finance, defended the company's tax arrangements before a UK parliamentary committee. Noting that its average global tax rate for the past five years was 19 percent, Hutchinson said Google paid &quot;a fair amount&quot; of tax worldwide.</p> <p class=\"indent\">He also said that the complex structure through which Google moves most of its international profits through its Dutch subsidiary and then on to Bermuda, &quot;made sense&quot; given that the US government taxes companies on their foreign income if they bring it back into the US This gives multinationals an incentive to keep those profits overseas and in locations with little or no corporate tax.</p> <p class=\"indent\">At the end of 2015, Alphabet's foreign subsidiaries were holding $43 billion (NZ$64 billion) in cash untaxed by the US, according to the company's SEC filings.</p>","images":[{"id":13975624,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T195540+1300","datetime_display":"19:55 20/02/2016","creditline":"Reuters","caption":"Google parent Alphabet saved $2.4 billion with its 'Dutch sandwich'.","variants":[{"id":13975624,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455951340/624/13975624.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"59"}]},{"id":13975625,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T195540+1300","datetime_display":"19:55 20/02/2016","creditline":"Reuters","caption":"Google parent Alphabet saved $2.4 billion with its 'Dutch sandwich'.","variants":[{"id":13975625,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455951340/625/13975625.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"620","height":"349"}]},{"id":13975626,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T195540+1300","datetime_display":"19:55 20/02/2016","creditline":"Reuters","caption":"Google parent Alphabet saved $2.4 billion with its 'Dutch sandwich'.","variants":[{"id":13975626,"layout":"Strap Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455951340/626/13975626.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"300","height":"199"}]},{"id":13975628,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T195540+1300","datetime_display":"19:55 20/02/2016","creditline":"Reuters","caption":"Google parent Alphabet saved $2.4 billion with its 'Dutch sandwich'.","variants":[{"id":13975628,"layout":"Defcon Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455951340/628/13975628.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"418","height":"220"}]},{"id":13975629,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T195540+1300","datetime_display":"19:55 20/02/2016","creditline":"Reuters","caption":"Google parent Alphabet saved $2.4 billion with its 'Dutch sandwich'.","variants":[{"id":13975629,"layout":"ipad section splash 956:956","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455951340/629/13975629.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"956","height":"956"}]}]},{"id":77102051,"path":"/sport/golf/77102051/World-No-1-Lydia-Ko-surges-into-contention-at-the-Aus-Open","url":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/_json/sport/golf/77102051/World-No-1-Lydia-Ko-surges-into-contention-at-the-Aus-Open","section":"Golf","section-home":"Golf","section-top-level":"Sport","layout":"landscape-image","title":"World No 1 Lydia Ko surges into contention at the Aus Open ","subhead":null,"alt_headline":"Ko moves into fourth","datetime_iso8601":"20160220T195129+1300","datetime_display":"19:51 20/02/2016","byline":"PETER THORNTON ","intro":"World No 1 Lydia Ko has surged into contention with a four-under par 68 at the Australian Open in Adelaide on Saturday. ","alt_intro":"World No 1 fires six birdies to be just one shot off the lead.
