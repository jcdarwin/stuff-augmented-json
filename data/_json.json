The hospice has to raise about $6 million per year on its own to fund its services, alongside $5m from government funding.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;We were hugely appreciative and overjoyed, and turning it from what we got into something we can work with has been our challenge,&quot; she said.</p> <p>The Hospice has since fully renovated the apartment, fitting it out with donated furniture from its second-hand stores.</p> <p>She said the charity, which provides specialist care for people living with a terminal illness, had once received a bequest of $1m, but most were smaller donations.</p> <p>&quot;We're really lucky the way the Wellington public and others look out for Mary Potter,&quot; she said.</p> <p>The flat <a href=\"http://www.loweandco.nz/listing/LOWE1082\" target=\"_blank\"><b>went on the market</b></a> last week, and had its first open home this weekend.&nbsp;</p> <p>The 40m2, one double-bedroom apartment with parking was tendering for offers over $149,000.</p> <p>Lowe &amp; Co real estate agent Adam Cockburn said he heard about the house through a contact at Mary Potter Hospice, and offered to sell it for them for no commission.</p> <p>&quot;They do such a good job, I thought it would be a nice thing to give back to the community and give back to families in need,&quot; he said.</p> <p>He said people would be hard-pressed to find a nicely renovated one-bedroom at a better price.</p> <p>&quot;It's&nbsp;offers over $149,000, so that's pretty affordable, I don't think there's anything any cheaper out there.&quot;</p> <p>Cockburn said the Wellington housing market was &quot;really starting to move&quot; now, after eight years of flat house prices.</p> <p>The&nbsp;tender closes at 1pm, 10 March.</p>","images":[{"id":13980529,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T174800+1300","datetime_display":"17:48 21/02/2016","creditline":"MARY POTTER HOSPICE","source_code":"the-dominion-post","source_name":"The Dominion Post","caption":"A one-bedroom apartment has gone on sale in Berhampore, Wellington after a mystery man left it to Mary Potter Hospice in his will.","variants":[{"id":13980529,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456030080/529/13980529.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"60"}]},{"id":13980530,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T174800+1300","datetime_display":"17:48 21/02/2016","creditline":"MARY POTTER HOSPICE","source_code":"the-dominion-post","source_name":"The Dominion Post","caption":"A one-bedroom apartment has gone on sale in Berhampore, Wellington after a mystery man left it to Mary Potter Hospice in his will.","variants":[{"id":13980530,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456030080/530/13980530.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"620","height":"348"}]},{"id":13980531,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T174800+1300","datetime_display":"17:48 21/02/2016","creditline":"MARY POTTER HOSPICE","source_code":"the-dominion-post","source_name":"The Dominion Post","caption":"A one-bedroom apartment has gone on sale in Berhampore, Wellington after a mystery man left it to Mary Potter Hospice in his will.","variants":[{"id":13980531,"layout":"Strap Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456030080/531/13980531.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"300","height":"200"}]},{"id":13980533,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T174800+1300","datetime_display":"17:48 21/02/2016","creditline":"MARY POTTER HOSPICE","source_code":"the-dominion-post","source_name":"The Dominion Post","caption":"A one-bedroom apartment has gone on sale in Berhampore, Wellington after a mystery man left it to Mary Potter Hospice in his will.","variants":[{"id":13980533,"layout":"Defcon Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456030080/533/13980533.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"418","height":"219"}]},{"id":13980534,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T174800+1300","datetime_display":"17:48 21/02/2016","creditline":"MARY POTTER HOSPICE","source_code":"the-dominion-post","source_name":"The Dominion Post","caption":"A one-bedroom apartment has gone on sale in Berhampore, Wellington after a mystery man left it to Mary Potter Hospice in his will.","variants":[{"id":13980534,"layout":"ipad section splash 956:956","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456030080/534/13980534.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"956","height":"954"}]}],"galleries":[{"id":13980541,"url":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/_json/13980541/Mystery-man-bequests-home-to-Mary-Potter-Hospice","layout":"Image Gallery","section":"Stuff","section-home":"Home & Property","title":"Mystery man bequests home to Mary Potter Hospice","datetime_iso8601":null,"datetime_display":"22:33 21/02/2016","intro":null,"images":[{"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T174800+1300","datetime_display":"17:48 21/02/2016","creditline":"MARY POTTER HOSPICE","source_code":"the-dominion-post","source_title":"The Dominion Post","caption":"A one-bedroom apartment has gone on sale in Berhampore, Wellington after a mystery man left it to Mary Potter Hospice in his will.","variants":[{"id":13980535,"layout":"1024 Landscape","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456030080/535/13980535.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"911","height":"683"}]},{"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T174800+1300","datetime_display":"17:48 21/02/2016","creditline":"MARY POTTER HOSPICE","source_code":"the-dominion-post","source_title":"The Dominion Post","caption":"The apartment is at 118 Russell Terrace, Berhampore, Wellington.","variants":[{"id":13980536,"layout":"1024 Landscape","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456030080/536/13980536.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"1024","height":"680"}]},{"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T174800+1300","datetime_display":"17:48 21/02/2016","creditline":"MARY POTTER HOSPICE","source_code":"the-dominion-post","source_title":"The Dominion Post","caption":"The north facing apartment is said to get excellent year round sun.

These families will have lost everything.&quot;</p> <p>Winston was the most powerful storm ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere.</p> <p>After twice hammering outlying islands in nearby Tonga last week, the storm re-intensified on Saturday and began to track west towards Suva, the capital of Fiji, packing winds of 230kmh, with gusts of up to 325kmh.</p> <p>Hours before the storm hit land, Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama warned the nation was facing an ordeal &quot;of the most grievous kind&quot; as tropical Cyclone Winston begins to batter the country.</p> <p>He urged Fijians to prepare themselves for a &quot;terrible event&quot;.</p> <p>Fiji-based meteorologist at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nadraki.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Na Draki</a>,&nbsp;Neville Koop, said some parts of the country &quot;are going to be very, very severely impacted&quot;.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;[Cyclone Winston] was a category 5 cyclone which is the strongest you can get and certainly the strongest I can recall in Fiji. We won't know the full details for some time.&quot;</p> <p>He feared for the people further north, whose home will have been destroyed.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;If they left their broken homes, looking for shelter, they could have found themselves in trouble.&quot;</p> <p><b>KIWIS ON THE GROUND</b></p> <p>There are 186 New Zealanders currently registered in Fiji with its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.safetravel.govt.nz/\">SafeTravel website</a>, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said.

stricken Steve Smith fearing he was badly hurt after his bouncer struck the Australian captain behind the left ear on day two of the second test in Christchurch.</p> <p>&quot;It's not nice is it; a bit of a shaky feeling. It's never one's intention to hit someone in the head and see him go down like that. I think a hell of a lot of credit to him to take a blow like that and stand up and bat the way he did. It shows the character of the bloke,&quot; Wagner said.</p> <p>Smith was on 78 when the bouncer didn't get up as much as he expected. The sickening sound echoed around the ground as Smith's knees buckled and he fell forward. Every time a batsman is struck now, the memories of Australian batsman Philip Hughes' death are never far away.</p> <p><b>READ MORE:<br /> *&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/cricket/77108809/neil-wagners-late-double-strike-gives-flagging-black-caps-hope-at-hagley\" target=\"_blank\">Late wickets give hope<br /> </a>*&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/cricket/77106889/australian-team-rubbish-rumours-of-adam-voges-wearing-glove-while-fielding\" target=\"_blank\">Aus fuming over Voges claim<br /> </a>*&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/cricket/77116038/streaker-draws-biggest-cheer-until-neil-wagners-double-breakthrough\" target=\"_blank\">A rude break to the tedium</a></b></p> <p>&quot;I ran up straight to him and he flashed his eyes a little bit and I was a bit worried at the start and he said he's fine. He took a bit of time, which we all said 'make sure you take enough time and get yourself ready, we'll give you what every you need', so he did and he looked fine after that,&quot; Wagner said.</p> <p>It certainly didn't slow Smith down as he confidently pulled the next Wagner short ball in front of square, and went on to his 14th test century, scoring 138.</p> <p>Batting partner Joe Burns was worried at the other end, too.</p> <p>&quot;Certainly it's always a concern when you see someone get hit in the head. It got him quite flush as well, which was a concerning part. But fortunately the medical staff were out there very quickly and they gave him the all clear. I think luckily the tea break was just around the corner. It gave him a chance to sit down for 20 minutes and I guess just let the shock settle.&quot;</p>","images":[{"id":13981428,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T210520+1300","datetime_display":"21:05

police had a duty to look after anyone brought into the cells, but they could not be expected to have the expertise to care for the mentally ill.</p> <p>Cell-blocks were so busy officers were not managing to monitor those inside, resulting in suicide attempts or failure to get medical attention, the review found.</p> <p>Police predicted they would receive about 54,000 mental-health related calls for help over the next year, many concerning people threatening or attempting suicide.&nbsp;</p> <p>Counties-Manukau, Waitemata, and Christchurch had already reduced their numbers of mental health assessments in police custody by performing them in emergency departments instead.</p> <p>Police and the Ministry of Health have confirmed they are now working to expand the approach to every District Health Board (DHB) around the country.</p> <p>The Ministry's Director of Mental Health Dr John Crawshaw said the health system was adequately resourced to handle the change.</p> <p>&quot;DHBs need to think about how they can best meet the need for assessment of people who come to notice of police. This may be at home, in an inpatient unit or less commonly, at an emergency department.&quot;</p> <p>It was up to individual DHBs to decide whether the change merited extra security measures, he said.</p> <p>&quot;Most people who come to the attention of police in relation to mental health problems do not present a risk to others. People who have been arrested for serious offending may be transferred to an inpatient unit or a forensic mental health service, or assessed in police cells if necessary.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p>Police had accepted the IPCA's findings and agreed custody detention should be used only as a &quot;last resort,&quot;&nbsp;Inspector Sue Douglas, police mental health team project manager, said.</p> <p>People suffering from mental distress, or who are drunk or on drugs, made up a &quot;significant&quot; proportion of people taken into custody daily, police headquarters response manager&nbsp;Inspector Jason Ross said.</p> <p>Police were &quot;often left in the difficult position of having to take those experiencing these complex problems into custody because there are no other appropriate alternatives, and they feel compelled to act to ensure their safety,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Mental Health Foundation chief executive Judi Clements welcomed the change.</p> <p>She said police were often lumped with the responsibility to care for the mentally ill as the first responders to a call-out – but for someone in distress, the cells could be a disturbing environment.</p> <p>&quot;Just imagine it from their point of view. If you or I were feeling really down or upset in such a state that you were escorted away by a uniformed police officer to a cell or holding room ... it's not likely to calm a person or give them the support they need.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>LOCKED-UP AND UNDER STRESS&nbsp;</b></p> <p>A March 2015 IPCA report highlighted specific cases.</p> <p>●&nbsp;<b>August 2013, Hastings:</b>&nbsp;Police arrested a woman who seemed to be in good spirits. But they failed to check an alert warning of her suicidal tendencies. She was charged with burglary and told her bail would be opposed and the custody officer noted her changed demeanour but did not order reassessment or monitoring. Two hours later she was found after attempting suicide.</p> <p>●&nbsp;<b>January 2013, Lower Hutt:</b>&nbsp;A woman remanded into police custody in Lower Hutt thought to have taken pills told officers they were just four sleeping pills and they believed her. Over the next hour, custody officers had to shout to keep her awake. Shortly after being transferred to prison she was hospitalised for a codeine overdose.</p> <p>●&nbsp;<b>October 2012, Masterton:</b>&nbsp;Police arrested a man who had recently attempted suicide. He was hospitalised for his breathing difficulties, then returned to police custody. The watch-house duty constable did not remove the man's hospital pyjamas and place him in a suicide resistant gown &quot;due to his happy demeanour&quot; and a plan to monitor him. But the following morning the man attempted to suffocate himself.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>CRIES FOR HELP BY NUMBERS</b></p> <p>The police annual report for in the 2014/15 financial year shows:</p> <ul> <li>Since the mid-1990s the number of police incidents involving someone suffering from acute mental distress has increased by three and a half times.</li> <li>Incidents involving threatened or attempted suicide have increased by eight times.</li> <li>Of all people reported missing almost three-quarters are current mental health patients including dementia patients.</li> <li>Police took 4245 repeat mental health calls last year.</li> <li>Overall they undertook 14,921 mental health investigations nationwide that had nothing to do with criminal behaviour –&nbsp;such as mental health incidents, attempted suicides, and missing persons.The previous year they had investigated 13,102 such cases.</li> </ul>","images":[{"id":13980362,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T172727+1300","datetime_display":"17:27 21/02/2016","creditline":"CHRISTEL YARDLEY/FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"waikato-times","source_name":"Waikato Times","caption":"A police cell is not an appropriate place for someone in a state of mental distress, authorities have agreed.","variants":[{"id":13980362,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456028847/362/13980362.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"60"}]},{"id":13980363,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T172727+1300","datetime_display":"17:27 21/02/2016","creditline":"CHRISTEL YARDLEY/FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"waikato-times","source_name":"Waikato Times","caption":"A police cell is not an appropriate place for someone in a state of mental distress, authorities have agreed.","variants":[{"id":13980363,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456028847/363/13980363.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"620","height":"349"}]},{"id":13980364,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T172728+1300","datetime_display":"17:27 21/02/2016","creditline":"CHRISTEL YARDLEY/FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"waikato-times","source_name":"Waikato Times","caption":"A police cell is not an appropriate place for someone in a state of mental distress, authorities have agreed.","variants":[{"id":13980364,"layout":"Strap Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456028848/364/13980364.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"300","height":"200"}]},{"id":13980366,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T172728+1300","datetime_display":"17:27 21/02/2016","creditline":"CHRISTEL YARDLEY/FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"waikato-times","source_name":"Waikato Times","caption":"A police cell is not an appropriate place for someone in a state of mental distress, authorities have agreed.","variants":[{"id":13980366,"layout":"Defcon Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456028848/366/13980366.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"418","height":"220"}]},{"id":13980367,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T172728+1300","datetime_display":"17:27 21/02/2016","creditline":"CHRISTEL YARDLEY/FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"waikato-times","source_name":"Waikato Times","caption":"A police cell is not an appropriate place for someone in a state of mental distress, authorities have agreed.","variants":[{"id":13980367,"layout":"ipad section splash 956:956","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456028848/367/13980367.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"956","height":"956"}]}]},{"id":77116984,"path":"/world/77116984/Man-arrested-over-random-shooting-in-Michigan-that-kills-seven","url":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/_json/world/77116984/Man-arrested-over-random-shooting-in-Michigan-that-kills-seven","section":"Stuff","section-home":"World","section-top-level":"World","layout":"landscape-image","title":"Man arrested over random shooting in Michigan that kills seven","subhead":null,"alt_headline":"Man arrested over random shooting","datetime_iso8601":"20160221T214515+1300","datetime_display":"21:45 21/02/2016","byline":null,"intro":"A gunman drove in and around a western Michigan city randomly shooting people in the parking lots of a restaurant, car dealership and apartment complex, killing at least seven, including a 14-year-old girl, authorities said.","alt_intro":"A 14-year-old girl among seven people fatally shot.

href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/golf/77010274/lydia-ko-named-young-new-zealander-of-the-year\">Ko young New Zealander of the year</a></b></p> <p>&quot;It's a good start to the season,&quot; said Ko after her round.</p> <p>&quot;If I had won this week it would have obviously been better, but Haru played amazing golf. I think that's the thing about this game - there are things that are really out of your hands and all you've got to do is just try your best.&quot;</p> <p>Ko said she could sense that Nomura was on a hot streak down the home stretch - &nbsp;one that included birdies on five of the final nine holes.</p> <p>&quot;By the roars I could hear, she seemed like she was holing a lot of putts. When another player does it, it's really out of my hands.&quot;</p> <p>The pair were tied for first as they began the back nine, and it was with a birdie on the 10th that the Japanese moved into the lead she would hold until the end - though Ko did her best to try and chase her down.</p> <p>With Nomura having opened up a two-stroke lead - 15-under to 13-under, just moments earlier, Ko sank a birdie putt on the par-four 16th - a hole she hadn't shot below par on all event - to ensure the contest would continue for a little while longer.</p> <p>But then Nomura hit straight back, restoring her advantage, and when Ko could only manage par on the 17th, the writing was on the wall.</p> <p>Before Ko could finish the 18th, Nomura had birdied the 17th and teed off on the 18th, her prey within sight.</p> <p>Ko bogeyed the last, and so did Nomura, who finished seven-under for the day and 16-under overall.</p> <p>As Nomura's final putt sank, Ko was the first to join her celebrations, spraying water over her, and she said it was great to see Nomura notch her first LPGA win.</p> <p>&quot;She's got a great personality, so congratulations to her.&quot;</p> <p>As the final round began, 23-year-old Nomura was playing in the last group, alongside American Danielle Kang, with Ko in the pairing ahead, alongside South Korean Jenny Shin.</p> <p>That meant Nomura always knew what Ko had done, and thus what she had to do to stay ahead, and as it turned out, she managed to do exactly that, claiming her first LPGA tour win.</p> <p>The Australian Open was one of five LPGA titles Ko won last year, and her failure to defend it means the 18-year-old remains without a tour victory so far this season, although she did win her home event, the New Zealand Open, last weekend.</p> <p>Ko said she would not play in next weekend's LPGA event in Thailand, with the Women's Champions tournament in Singapore on March 3 her next outing.</p> <p>Nomura had started slowly in the final round, missing birdies that others grabbed in the first few holes, but began to find her mark as she progressed through the front nine, birdying the fifth and sixth and then the ninth.</p> <p>Ko began with two birdies - including on the first for the fourth time in four days - then added another on the fifth.</p> <p>Despite their different methods of getting there, both were three-under for the day at the turn, which meant Nomura held a one-shot lead overall.</p> <p>When Nomura birdied the 10th, she opened up a two-stroke gap for the first time, but Ko quickly pegged her back with birdies of her own on the 12th and 13th, setting up a grandstand finish.</p> <p>The duo had been two of four contenders that emerged on Sunday afternoon.</p> <p>After beginning with three birdies in five holes, Australian Karrie Webb was unable to keep up her charge, dropping back to finish nine-under and third.</p> <p>Kang was also there or thereabouts, but just couldn't get the birdies like Nomura and Ko did, and so slipped to eight-under and a tie for fourth with a bogey on the final hole.</p> <p>The final round began with five players separated by one stroke at the head of the field, but Ko's playing partner Shin quickly fell out of touch with the others.</p> <p>In the end, it was Nomura, some 66 places below Ko in the world rankings, who prevailed, claiming her first tour win in her sixth season as a pro.</p> <p>★★★</p> <p><b>Ko's final round ... as it happened</b></p> <p><b>Hole 18 (par 4): </b>Ko finishes with a bogey as Nomura birdies back on 17, which means that barring a meltdown, this one's over, with Ko second, 13-under to Nomura's 17-under at present.</p> <p><b>Hole 17 (par 4): </b>Nomura continues her charge, birdying 16 as well, which means Ko needs to birdie 17 ... and she misses a long putt well wide to the right. Curtains?</p> <p><b>Hole 16 (par 4):</b> After Nomura birdies 15 to open up a two-shot lead, Ko birdies the 16th to bring it back to one. Big finish on the cards here.</p> <p><b>Hole 15 (par 4): </b>Ko has a long putt for birdie and a share of the lead ... and it just goes wide to the left. Still one back with three to play after she pars.</p> <p><b>Hole 14 (par 3):</b> Ko pars, but Nomura birdies behind her to retake the lead.</p> <p><b>Hole 13 (par 5): </b>Another big birdie, and Ko is back tied for the lead. Huge stuff.</p> <p><b>Hole 12 (par 3):</b> Needing to step up, Ko sinks a great birdie putt to move a shot back from Nomura.</p> <p><b>Hole 11 (par 4): </b>Ko does brilliantly to get to the green in two shots, but can't get the birdie. Meanwhile, Nomura does on the 10th, opening up a two-shot lead.</p> <p><b>Hole 10 (par 5): </b>Ko can only par the 10th, as Nomura birdies the ninth to take the lead for herself. Next is the 11th, which she has bogeyed twice this tournament.</p> <p><b>Hole nine (par 4): </b>Ko misses a long birdie putt by a few inches, and so remains tied for the lead as she finishes the front 9 three-under for the day.&nbsp;Ko and playing partner Shin are playing rather slow.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Hole eight (par 3): </b>Ko pars again - after a long effort for birdie is well wide. Nomura has now moved up to share the lead with her, with Kang and Webb just one shot back.</p> <p><b>Hole seven (par 4):</b> Ko gets par again, after narrowly missing her birdie putt.</p> <p><b>Hole six (par 4):</b> Ko gets par - but moves into the outright lead as Webb drops a shot on the seventh. Nomura has now joined Webb and Kang at 10-under. Those four looking like the contenders.</p> <p><b>Hole five (par 5): </b>Having made the green in two, Ko misses her eagle putt by a couple of feet, but claims the birdie to move&nbsp;back into a share of the lead. Kang birdies the fourth to sit one back at 10-under.</p> <p><b>Hole four (par 3): </b>Another par hole for Ko, which gives Australian Karrie Webb a chance to move ahead with a birdie of her own on the fifth, and she duly does.</p> <p><b>Hole three (par 4): </b>Par for Ko after a long putt for birdie pulls up short. Webb has joined her in the lead at 10-under. Shin, Kang and Nomura are all one shot back.</p> <p><b>Hole two (par 4): </b>Ko reaches the green in two, then grabs her second birdie of the day to move into the outright lead at 10-under.</p> <p><b>Hole one (par 5): </b>Ko birdies it for the fourth time this tournament, after reaching the green in three shots. Playing partner Shin runs into trouble in the form of a bunker, and can only manage a bogey.</p>","images":[{"id":13981443,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T212417+1300","datetime_display":"21:24

Mainly, they extracted infected teeth.</p> <p>The team of eight from Waikato Hospital included dentists, surgeons and dental assistants. They travelled to just outside of Lautoka, a city in the west of Fiji, on January 30 and set up an outdoor clinic for patients.&nbsp;</p> <p>The trust was established in 2014 by previous and current DHB surgeons and staff. They wanted to do a charity specific to the Pacific Islands, because they felt that there was a dental need there. They formed their own charity and raised the funds themselves. And once sufficient funds and equipment were raised, they put a team together.</p> <p><b>READ MORE:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/news/69421735/waikato-dentists-deliver-smiles-to-fiji\">Waikato dentists deliver smiles to Fiji</a></p> <p>Consultant oral and maxillofacial surgeon at Waikato Hospital Simon&nbsp;Lou said Fiji was chosen because it is still a developing country with an enormous dental demand, and there were Fijian connections through staff that could help them get there.&nbsp;</p> <p>In June, 2015, the trust members travelled to Fiji for the first time and saw 250 patients, pulling out around 400 infected teeth over four days. This year, numbers were significantly higher.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lou travelled to Fiji both times, overseeing the project and giving guidance when needed.</p> <p>&quot;This trip was an absolute resounding success and really built on the success of our first mission. And I think we surprised ourselves, even about the numbers of patients we were able to treat.</p> <p>&quot;Our first mission, we had no idea how many patients we could see, and we thought that was really quite an amazing achievement, given the conditions.&quot;</p> <p>He said it was difficult to judge whether the dental state of Fiji was getting better or worse.</p> <p>&quot;I guess it shows there is a huge amount of dental need in Fiji. It's just how many patients we can treat as a team, and we just managed to get through more this year.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p>On their final day, they treated 80 patients and had to turn away 100.</p> <p>&quot;It's almost like a never-ending demand,&quot; Lou said.</p> <p>The last three people they treated travelled from the other side of Lotuka, and had arrived as the team were packing up on the final day.</p> <p>Lou said where they came from was around a 20-minute drive. The patients had taken a bus as far as it would go and walked the rest of the way.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;We had started to dismantle the clinic, and had taken down a lot of the stuff because we had finished. But when we found out they had come from the other side, we agreed to treat them.&quot;</p> <p>He said the dental health of the patients they treated were at a point where conservative dentistry, such as fillings, was impossible.</p> <p>&quot;You have to be realistic about what you can do. We were not fully equipped to do those procedures [fillings]. To get through that number of patients, to give patients real relief, we take out the teeth.&quot;</p> <p>Lou said they had to bring all their own gear with them, including tools, medication, needles and gloves. On top of that, he said conditions were extremely hot.</p> <p>&quot;Most days were 34 degrees, but 99 per cent humidity. No air conditioning, but we luckily did have fans.&quot;</p> <p>This year was maxillofacial senior house surgeon Neil Piccione's first trip to Fiji with the trust.</p> <p>The 26 year old said being able to provide the treatment for free was incredibly rewarding.</p> <p>&nbsp;&quot;A fair few of my patients broke down in tears of gratitude once I had finished treatment, which really left me with a great sense of fufilment and purpose.&quot;</p> <p>The trust is already planning a third mission.&nbsp;</p> <div> &quot;We've exhausted most of our supplies we had, and the funds, so the next mission all depends on how we go fundraising,&quot; Lou said. </div> <div> &nbsp; </div>","images":[{"id":13981383,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T205032+1300","datetime_display":"20:50 21/02/2016","creditline":"SUPPLIED","source_code":"waikato-times","source_name":"Waikato Times","caption":"The Island of Smiles Charitable Trust in Fiji, providing free dental treatment to patients.

These are high risk individuals who have drug and alcohol problems. This is something of real concern and we want to front-foot that,&quot; McKenzie said.</p> <p>Information was being fed to police that a shortage of housing and funding cuts for outreach &nbsp;programmes were adding to the homeless problem in Auckland, McKenzie said,</p> <p>&quot;They [homeless] see Wellington as an affluent city and perceive accommodation to be freely available.&quot;</p> <p>Wellington City Council community services and emergency welfare manager Jenny Rains said many homeless people in Wellington were ex-prisoners.</p> <p>&quot;The night shelter at the moment has a lot of ex-prisoners who are struggling,&quot; she said.</p> <p>In the short-term there was help at the night shelter and in the long-term there were outreach teams trying to co-ordinate with them, she said.</p> <p>&quot;It's not as easy as you might think.&quot;</p> <p>Wellington City Councillor Paul Eagle, who chairs a city safety committee, said finding accommodation for gang members was important because without a roof over their head, it would spell trouble.</p> <p>Council had a strategy to help prisoners better integrate into society and had worked with police and corrections to house ex-prisoners and gang members in the past.</p> <p>Corrections acting lower north operations director Coralea Easther, said suitable accommodation and supporting offenders to make positive changes in their lives and reduce their chance of reoffending was important.</p> <p>Some offenders needed help to find stable accommodation, which may also form part of an offender's release conditions.</p> <p>Community Corrections worked with organisations, such as Housing New Zealand, New Zealand Prisoners Aid and Rehabilitation Society, the Salvation Army and other social service agencies, when reviewing an offender's housing options.</p> <p>Probation officers had close links with accommodation providers, other stakeholders and local community groups, and worked to ensure the basic needs of the offenders were provided wherever possible, she said.</p> <p>In 2013 Corrections introduced the Out of Gate service, designed to support short-serving prisoners before and immediately after they leave prison when they are trying to readjust to life on the outside and are most at risk of reoffending.</p> <p>A Wellington City Council report on beggars is expected to be brought to council in April to consider actions and solutions. So far it has found that although begging and homelessness crossed over, the majority of those begging were not homeless.</p> <p>A member of the team compiling the data told the CBD meeting, the prisoner situation was a further issue, which went beyond what Wellington could deal with – adding another &quot;bag of challenging issues&quot;.</p> <p>An Auckland &nbsp;homeless report, released by the Salvation Army&nbsp;in November, stated one of the key causes of homelessness in the super-city was exclusion from the rental market.</p> <p>The report blamed a lack of supply and said because landlords had so much choice in who they rented their houses to, a level of discrimination was more likely.</p> <p>The report recommended that rising rents in the city be addressed as well as increasing the supply of affordable housing.</p> <p>It also said it was possible that some of the people interviewed were on a bail release from Epsom Lodge or other places, which would account for a response that identified prison as the impending accommodation.</p> <p>The report said there would be an incentive for former prisoners to seek accommodation as a continuation of bail, or a non-prison sentence could be reliant on the person providing evidence to the court they had stable accommodation.</p>","images":[{"id":13981101,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T191432+1300","datetime_display":"19:14 21/02/2016","creditline":"MAARTEN HOLL/FAIRFAX/NZ","source_code":"the-dominion-post","source_name":"The Dominion Post","caption":"The Auckland housing crisis has displaced homeless ex-prisoners from the supercity, who are now shifting to Wellington.","variants":[{"id":13981101,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456035272/101/13981101.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"60"}]},{"id":13981102,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T191432+1300","datetime_display":"19:14 21/02/2016","creditline":"MAARTEN HOLL/FAIRFAX/NZ","source_code":"the-dominion-post","source_name":"The Dominion Post","caption":"The Auckland housing crisis has displaced homeless ex-prisoners from the supercity, who are now shifting to Wellington.","variants":[{"id":13981102,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456035272/102/13981102.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"620","height":"349"}]},{"id":13981103,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T191432+1300","datetime_display":"19:14 21/02/2016","creditline":"MAARTEN HOLL/FAIRFAX/NZ","source_code":"the-dominion-post","source_name":"The Dominion Post","caption":"The Auckland housing crisis has displaced homeless ex-prisoners from the supercity, who are now shifting to Wellington.","variants":[{"id":13981103,"layout":"Strap Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456035272/103/13981103.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"300","height":"200"}]},{"id":13981105,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T191432+1300","datetime_display":"19:14 21/02/2016","creditline":"MAARTEN HOLL/FAIRFAX/NZ","source_code":"the-dominion-post","source_name":"The Dominion Post","caption":"The Auckland housing crisis has displaced homeless ex-prisoners from the supercity, who are now shifting to Wellington.","variants":[{"id":13981105,"layout":"Defcon Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456035272/105/13981105.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"418","height":"219"}]},{"id":13981106,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T191432+1300","datetime_display":"19:14 21/02/2016","creditline":"CHRIS MCKEEN/FAIRFAX NZ","caption":"A homeless man in Auckland's CBD.

the Tattoo pull people into Wellington from across the country.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;It's critical for the city in terms of supporting hospitality and retail to be able to secure these events that bring people from all around the country.&quot;</p> <p>Wellington Regional Economic Development Agency&nbsp;chief executive Chris Whelan agreed the economic benefit was important, but it went beyond that.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;The energy one feels in town, the atmosphere is electric, which is really good.&quot;</p> <p>It was too soon to put a figure on how much had been injected into the capital's economy, but the Tattoo alone was expected to pull about $16m. &nbsp;</p> <p>Executive chair of the New Zealand festival Kerry Prendergast said the Tattoo kicked off the 30th anniversary of the New

These logistics will take more than a season or two to sort out, but they are not especially unusual. Every other industry is grappling with new technologies, trying to find a footing in order to move forward and thrive.<br /> <br /> But fashion tells us something about how women are perceived in this moment, how they are living and their current priorities and desires.

He mounted his show in the Park Avenue Armory, a vast space with an expansive white set surrounded by four rows of stacked seating.

Patchwork dresses flowed on and on -- an endless river of richly hued satin and silk.</p> <p>There were patchwork coats that looked as though they had been assembled from a little of this and a little of that, the sum being more elegantly eccentric than the individual parts.</p> <p>Each garment became more intriguing the closer and longer one looked. It revealed itself slowly and delighted the eye. The clothes were fascinating. Even Lady Gaga, who walked the runway as a model, submersed herself in the clothes. She was not the star; Jacobs' oversize coat with fur sleeves was.</p> <p>The design duo behind Proenza Schouler alternated between knit dresses that hugged the body and trousers that almost floated around it. Each model had a nearly triangular silhouette created by clothes that fell down and out from a narrow shoulder frame.</p> <p>Jackets laced up like corsets and skirts were crafted from strips of fabric that wrapped loosely and erratically around the body. No one would declare such volume an easy style to wear. No one slips unnoticed into a room dragging extra yards of fabric. Oversized clothes announce your presence. The young men of early rap understood that. They dressed in big clothes, in part, to be big. They would not be ignored.</p> <p>At Calvin Klein, designer Francisco Costa brings artful details -- broken seams, frayed hems -- to roomy blazers and trousers. Elegant black dresses with starburst pleats form a straight line down the torso. Curves are under wraps. The line is the star.</p> <p>And Thom Browne might have taken his audience into wonderland of doggy-shaped handbags and embroidery, but his clothes were strong and bold and serious. A coat was layered with another coat. A jacket sat on top of a blazer.</p> <p>Clothes have become disconnected from the body. And it may have to do with our changing relationship to gender. It is being redefined as on a continuum rather than as a matter of either/or. The clothes are less likely to highlight hourglass shapes, cleavage, hips or other physical markers of masculinity and femininity. The clothes can be dramatic and dazzling, but they do not define us.</p> <p>No other brand underscores that more than Hood by Air. Designer Shayne Oliver stepped into fashion a few seasons ago with a mission of blurring gender lines and upending expectations. His influence rippled through the industry, seeping into Rihanna's collaboration with Puma and into brands such as Rag and Bone. His fall show was a controlled chaos of models strutting and running, preening and stumbling. Men wore spike heels. Women wore the face of brooding aggression. Black shearling jackets hung off the body like dark, flapping wings. Coats swaddled the torso.</p> <p>For some designers who see themselves as more connected to urban street culture than the boardroom or the charity circuit, the oversized clothes are worn on the runway with swagger. The models -- male and female -- are vaguely androgynous. Women do not move softly or daintily on wobbly heels. They stalk; they stomp in combat boots.</p> <p>There is overt power in these clothes. This is an election in which the look of power -- commander-in-chief power -- could be historically altered. A woman could be the face of ultimate clout. And so designers offer up a next generation of power dressing. It is not rooted in the old notions of trim suits and sheath dresses and sturdy heels. That look is obsolete, ineffective. The new cynosure is big. The clothes allow women to take up more space. They can fill a room with their physical presence.</p> <p>The work coming out of old-guard houses seems too gentle and precious for these times of brawling politics and incivility. The clothes from Carolina Herrera and Oscar de la Renta's Peter Copping are so pretty. They seem to have come from a era before Martin Skreli and the San Francisco tech bro who complained to the mayor about the unsightly homeless people. People are mean. We need clothes as armor, not as artifice.</p> <p>Perhaps we can still connect with them in the evening, on formal occasions when we are more mannered or when our tone has been softened by a cocktail or two. The beauty is undeniable The question is whether, as a culture, we can appreciate it.</p> <p>So for fall, Jacobs suggests putting on a game face -- not a pretty face.</p> <p>These are times of political brawling, the Zika virus, terrorist fears, anger, rage, vitriol. Fashion is not here to put a gloss on reality. It's trying to help you survive it all.</p>","images":[{"id":13980522,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T174500+1300","datetime_display":"17:45 21/02/2016","creditline":"supplied","source_code":"the-nelson-mail","source_name":"The Nelson Mail","caption":"A model wears Denny Rose skinny jeans","variants":[{"id":13980522,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456029900/522/13980522.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"59"}]},{"id":13980523,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T174500+1300","datetime_display":"17:45 21/02/2016","creditline":"Getty Images","caption":"Rejoice!

She was in the driver's seat. The cops and fire services only got there few minutes after they had done this.</p> <p>Firefighters and groundsmen removed branches from the road and off the cars.</p> <p>A Fire Service spokesman said the area was cordoned off while the work was going on and firefighters were providing scene security for the crowd of on lookers that had gathered.</p> <p>An eye witness said there was a &quot;massive crunch&quot; when the tree fell and the back of one car was completely smashed under the impact.</p> <p>The owner of one of the damaged cars said the sound of the tree falling was like nothing she'd ever heard before.</p> <p>The woman, who asked not to be identified, said she heard cracking noises then a loud bang. She said she was thankful no one was in any of the cars.</p> <p>Cornwall Park Director Michael Ayrton said he is hugely relieved that that no one was hurt and is very sorry about the cars that were damaged.</p> <p>Ayrton said all the trees in the park had been assessed about three months ago, and a number had been recommended for removal but the one that fell wasn't one of them.</p> <p>&quot;It could have fell for a number of reasons, the main one being there has been about 40-50mm of rain in the past days and the excess water uptake could have weakened it's integrity.&quot;</p> <p>Ayrton has arranged for a leading eucalyptus specialist, Mike Wilcox to assess the tree on Monday morning to shed some light as to why it fell and also assess others in the vicinity.&nbsp;</p> <p>The tree was in excess of 100 feet tall, and about 85 years with a large crown.</p> <p>The park was extremely busy with Sunday afternoon visitors at the time.</p> <p>The tree fell near the Twin Oaks

The loss was their eighth from their last 11 games, which leaves them ninth on the table with just 19 points from 20 games - 10 points adrift of sixth place.</p> <p>But all through that run Merrick has been adamant his side were still in with a chance of making the finals. Not any more.</p> <p>&quot;I've always got an eye on next season, but I thought if we could get a win here we might scrape into the finals but we're not looking very good for that.&quot;</p> <p>So it is time to look back and ponder what went wrong.&nbsp;</p> <p>Key injuries didn't help at both ends of the park, while Merrick said a long run of games away from Wellington had hurt them.</p> <p>&quot;I think it's got something to do with travel, the last 17 rounds we've been in New Zealand six times, with only four at Westpac, so we don't seem to have home advantage any more, it's a fairly horrendous draw.</p> <p>&quot;I've never seen a schedule like this. There's lots of reasons for it, it's not necessarily the FFA's fault, it's partly our team and other teams' stadium access and what fits in, but I've never ever had a year like this with such a horrendous schedule.&quot;</p> <p>That came to head on Saturday night, as the Phoenix took a 2-1 lead into halftime, scoring all three of those goals thanks to a brace from Hamish Watson and an own goal to skipper Andrew Durante.&nbsp;</p> <p>Even at that point, they weren't good value for their lead, Merrick said.</p> <p>Newcastle equalised seven minutes into the second half through new Danish import Morten Nordstrand, before Watson got himself sent off in idiotic fashion in the 71st minute, picking up a second yellow card for interfering with a free kick deep in the Jets half.&nbsp;</p> <p>Nordstrand scored the winner 90 seconds after that. The Phoenix played better with 10 men but could not find an equaliser.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;The boys have got to have much greater drive on the field, they've got to be up to representing their team, and virtually the country, with a better attitude than that.&quot;</p> <p>At least there was the good news on Friday that the club have a guaranteed four years in the league, with two three-year top ups after that if they can meet certain conditions, including an increased broadcast deal and greater average attendance.</p> <p>But even the prospect of greener grass next season brought out Merrick's cynical side.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;...By having it rubber-stamped that's terrific, now I can start re-signing current players and signing some new players.</p> <p>&quot;We might get a couple of strikers with a bit of luck, we'll certainly get one and he'll probably get sent off in the first game and then [get] injured.&quot;</p> <p>Oh well, so much for that then.</p>","images":[{"id":13979404,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T141114+1300","datetime_display":"14:11 21/02/2016","creditline":null,"caption":"Hamish

council bungle had a woman frantically searching for hours for her car, only to realise it was parked around the corner from where it was towed.</p> <p>Tauranga woman Caren Hanlon parked her car on Bryce St in Hamilton city on Wednesday and paid for parking until 4.30pm.</p> <p>She said she returned to her vehicle at 4.42pm and was told by a shopkeeper that it had been towed.</p> <p>&quot;My first thoughts were oh my goodness it's been stolen,&quot; Hanlon said.</p> <p>&quot;So I went in to one of the shops there and the lady told me cars parked on the clearway get towed.</p> <p>&quot;Then I looked properly and there was the sign, Clearway 4.30 - 5.30 [Monday to Friday].&nbsp;And I thought, well that it probably has been towed, fair enough. But what do I do now? How do I know what towing company it is? Who do I call?&quot;</p> <p>Hanlon walked to the AA on Barton St and asked for the number for Hamilton City Council.</p> <p>&quot;I called council and a lady gave me the number and address of the Titan Towing company but it was just after 5pm and they had closed.</p> <p>&quot;I rang several times and left messages, explaining my situation. A friend picked me up and we drove to the address council gave us.</p> <p>&quot;My heart started racing, there was no tow company there.&quot;</p> <p>The address given to Hanlon from a council staff member was on Ellis St in Frankton.</p> <p>That company was Titan Towing, which sold its business to Active Towing on Norton Rd last year.</p> <p>&quot;The next day my friend and I spoke to someone from parking at the council and initially he gave us the Ellis St address, but looked into it further and said, 'oh the address has changed',&quot; Hanlon said.</p> <p>&quot;We spoke to the young chap at the tow company who called his boss who said he towed my car to Harwood St.</p> <p>&quot;If I had all the information in the first place I could have picked my car up and avoided all the anxiety and stress that I went through.</p> <p>&quot;It had all my clothes in it and my papers that I need, my food, everything.</p> <p>&quot;That's the whole point, I'm not begrudging the ticket. I will pay the ticket, that's fine because I was in the wrong.</p> <p>&quot;It's the fact that I didn't have a clue what to do after that.&quot;</p> <p>A former Hamilton towie, who asked not to be named, said he would park cars on either London St or Harwood St if he towed them from the CBD.</p> <p>&quot;Believe it or not, we actually don't like towing cars. We'd prefer to have the owner come back before we tow it because it avoids all the drama,&quot; he said.</p> <p>&quot;When I towed cars we had 6x4 stickers on the parking metres in the area of the clearway so owners would know where to collect their cars.&quot;</p> <p>The only signage on Bryce St near the clearway for those who have had their car towed is a sticker for Titan Towing, which is no longer in business, and a tow company called ToadAway.</p> <p>Hamilton City Council transport manager Jason Harrison said council did not communicate as effectively as it could have.</p> <p>&quot;We appreciate Mrs Hanlon accepts she was parked illegally, but to be honest, we could have handled this better. Under the circumstances we would like her to contact us and we will waive the infringement fee,&quot; he said.</p> <p>&quot;In some cases, to ensure safety, we will have a vehicle towed.&nbsp;We will also review signage we have in and around clearway areas to see if these can be improved.&quot;</p> <p>Harrison said anyone who has their car towed should contact police because towed cars are logged with the police northern communications centre.</p> <p>He said under current legislation a parking warden has the right to have a vehicle moved to any place where it does not constitute a traffic hazard and the tow-trucks tow them to nearby streets, so it is more convenient for the owners.</p> <p>Active Towing could not be reached for comment.</p>","images":[{"id":13981056,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T190136+1300","datetime_display":"19:01 21/02/2016","creditline":"REBEKAH PARSONS-KING/Fairfax NZ","source_code":"waikato-times","source_name":"Waikato Times","caption":"Tauranga woman Caren Hanlon's car was towed from a clear way to an unknown location.

not happen after future natural disasters.&nbsp;</p> <p>The protest group wanted legislation passed to fast-track settlement of all remaining claims and to impose penalties on EQC and insurers if they failed to meet the deadline.</p> <p>It also wanted an external review of EQC.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a statement, Grafton said insurance companies had settled 90 per cent of residential and commercial claims, worth $17 billion, despite the fact Canterbury's earthquakes were &quot;one of the largest, most complex insurance events globally&quot;.&nbsp;</p> <p>He said he understood &quot;the frustration experienced by people who have suffered&quot;, but in many cases delays were beyond the control of insurers.</p> <p>Reasons for delays included the need for geotech tests, the introduction of new building codes, and skill and material shortages.</p> <p>&quot;We believe for a future natural disaster that the Government should make changes so that all claims are lodged with your insurer who should have responsibility for assessing the claim.</p> <p>&quot;This would mean that the worst damaged houses would be identified by insurers early instead of receiving almost 1500 properties from EQC during 2015,&quot; Grafton said.</p>","images":[{"id":13980018,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T162036+1300","datetime_display":"16:20 21/02/2016","creditline":"John

I was very stern about it, and he knew I was not interested.&quot;</p> <p>He put his arm on her shoulder so she could not leave, and pushed her against a fence, she said.</p> <p>&quot;I was really angry and loud, so he walked away and I ran back to the house and told them [her friends].&quot;</p> <p>Her boyfriend and another man went out to the street to try and find him, and the woman sat on a couch at the rear of the section with a friend.</p> <p>&quot;He must have seen that I went down that driveway, so he came down and climbed over the couch,&quot; she said.</p> <p>The couch was not visible from the street so she was certain he followed her, she said.</p> <p>He tried to grab her on the couch.</p> <p>&quot;My friend said the look on his face was what scared her the most, because he didn't even notice she was there, he was just looking at me.&quot;</p> <p>The woman's friend leapt to her feet, shouted, and threw a can at him, and he ran away, she said.</p> <p>Police described the man as a Pacific Islander with a T-shirt and dark pants.</p> <p>The woman said he had a thin beard in a line along his jaw.</p> <p>&quot;[Police] were there really fast. I thought they would have had lots of things to deal with that night, I was quite surprised,&quot; the woman said.</p> <p>Her friends did most of the talking because she was too shocked to be much help, she said.</p> <p>Police referred her to Victim Support and she spoke to a woman who offered ongoing support.</p> <p>The woman was careful not to be by herself since Sunday, even if she was walking during the day, she said.</p> <p>She hoped that sharing her story would encourage somebody to come forward with information so the man could be caught before he tried to attack someone else, she said.</p> <p>She also hoped her story would serve as a warning to other women to avoid being alone at night.</p> <p>&quot;Ladies, watch out. Just be careful,&quot; she said.</p> <p>Police have asked anyone with information to call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>","images":[{"id":13980007,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T161444+1300","datetime_display":"16:14 21/02/2016","creditline":"DEREK FLYNN/FAIRFAX

There is no single person or group responsible. There were a number of small things that happened in a short period of time that led to this tragedy,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The family were aware of comments being posted on social media putting blame for Mitchell's death on one or two people.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;These false statements of blame are very hurtful to those people and our family. It was an accident of circumstance that involved alcohol,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>He thanked all the young people who had sat with Mitchell's twin Gerald and his sister Laura since his death.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;After today we must all move on. It will be tough to live without Mitchell in our lives. This will not be easy,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>He told mourners stories of Mitchell's adventures fishing, biking, tramping, canoeing and how he was happiest when on a farm.&nbsp;</p> <p>Mitchell had just moved out of home, got his licence and was working on a farm in Harihari.</p> <p>Ron's sister Linda said the young people who were with Mitchell at the party on the lake would relive that day for a long time.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;It is not a good way to start your adulthood. But I hope some good will come of this tragedy. Remember life is precious and death is real. Take care of each other and look after your mates. Be accountable and responsible for everything you do,&quot; she said.&nbsp;</p> <p>South Westland Area School principal Ross Brockbank spoke about Mitchell's many achievements in his short life. </p> <p>Mitchell was very close to his twin brother Gerald and older sister Laura, with the children growing up at the Hokitika Holiday Park, which the family owned until last year.</p> <p>In the 11 years he played for Wests Rugby Club, Mitchell lost only one grand final, club manager Jenny Keogan said.</p> <p>Mitchell's family had encouraged his friends to wear their school, rugby, Boys' Brigade or Scout uniforms or Mitchell's favourite colour, blue, to Saturday's funeral service.</p> <p>Scouts and rugby players formed a guard of honour as Mitchell's coffin was carried out of the service.&nbsp;</p>","images":[{"id":13979969,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T160500+1300","datetime_display":"16:05 21/02/2016","creditline":"SUPPLIED","source_code":"the-press","source_name":"The

worse than it was. He was hopeful his character and clean judicial record would be taken into account.</p> <p>Asked whether a suspension was inevitable, Kaino said: &quot;I hope not. It depends what it looks like. It might look worse than what I meant it to be. It's not what I intended to do.

North Korean defectors have told investigators from NGOs, including Human Rights Watch, that employees are forced to work long hours with minimal or sometimes no pay. Workers who do not obey orders are imprisoned in work camps.</p> <p>After Fairfax Media sent Rip Curl photos of its garments being made in North Korea, the company's chief financial officer&nbsp;Tony Roberts released a statement that said the firm &quot;takes its social compliance obligations seriously&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;We were aware of this issue, which related to our Winter 2015 Mountain-wear range, but only became aware of it after the production was complete and had been shipped to our retail customers.</p> <p>&quot;This was a case of a supplier diverting part of their production order to an unauthorised subcontractor, with the production done from an unauthorised factory, in an unauthorised country, without our knowledge or consent, in clear breach of our supplier terms and policies.</p> <p>&quot;We do not approve or authorise any production of Rip Curl products out of North Korea.&quot;</p> <p>It is unclear if, prior to the approach from Fairfax Media, Rip Curl has made any effort to inform customers some of the firm's clothing was made in North Korea and falsely tagged with &quot;made in China&quot;&nbsp;labels.</p> <p>Oxfam Australia's CEO Dr Helen Szoke​ said that the revelations raised serious questions about Rip Curl's standards.</p> <p>&quot;Australians would be shocked to hear that an iconic Australian brand with roots on the surf coast of Victoria can't confidently track clothing produced within its own supply chain.</p> <p>&quot;Rip Curl has no excuse for being unaware of what is happening. Companies are responsible for human rights abuses within their businesses – not only morally but also within international human rights frameworks,&quot; Dr Szoke said.</p> <p>Fairfax Media was given photos and videos of Rip Curl garments being made in North Korea by travellers who were taken on official tours of the factory by the North Korean government.</p> <p>Australian businessman and adventurer Nik Halik​ covertly photographed the garment's &quot;made in China&quot;&nbsp;labels while his official guide was distracted during a tour last July.</p> <p>Halik said he was shocked by his discovery and said Rip Curl customers had a right to know where the clothes were made.</p> <p>Oxfam's Dr Szoke called on Rip Curl to follow other Australian companies, including Kmart, Target and Coles, that&nbsp;publish the exact names and locations of their supplier factories.</p> <p>&quot;Companies such as Cotton On and Forever New are moving in this direction and it's high time that Rip Curl caught up with the pack,&quot; she said.</p> <p>&quot;Rip Curl needs to show the Australian public it's serious about preventing this from happening again through a dramatic overhaul of its checks and balances. It should start by publishing its policies and a list of the factories where its products are made,&quot; Dr Szoke said.</p> <p>Australian firms' garment-sourcing policies came under intense scrutiny in 2013, when hundreds of workers were killed in a Bangladeshi garment making complex, Rana Plaza, that collapsed. The tragedy caused several leading Australian brands to reform their clothes-sourcing practices.</p> <p>More than 90 per cent of garments sold in Australia are estimated to be sourced from Asia, while a huge proportionate of Asian garment workers are women who are paid minimal or &quot;poverty&quot;&nbsp;wages.</p> <p>Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union national secretary Michele O'Neil​&nbsp;said&nbsp;the revelation that Rip Curl's clothing had been made in North Korea was a &quot;shocking indictment on that company and its policies&quot;.</p> <p>O'Neil said she feared it was not an isolated case of a big-name brand failing to keep track of its supply chain and backed Oxfam's calls for Rip Curl to overhaul its garment sourcing practices.</p> <p>&quot;It's based solely on an endless search to find the cheapest possible labour,&quot; she said.</p> <p>O'Neil said the only reason Rip Curl's Chinese manufacturer would have contracted out the work to North Korea was because workers in that country were even cheaper because they had lower pay rates and worse health and safety conditions than those in China.</p> <p>Rip Curl was founded in 1969 in Torquay on the Victorian surf coast and has become one of the world's biggest surf brands.</p>","images":[{"id":13979826,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T153056+1300","datetime_display":"15:30

Sounds</a></b></p> <p>The cameras would relay real-time images of the channel back to Harbour Master staff.</p> <p>After a four to six week testing period, the images recorded by the cameras would become publicly available on the Marlborough District Council's website.</p> <p>The footage could be used by members of the public to check weather and boating conditions.&nbsp;</p> <p>Images of each location would appear on the site every 10 minutes.&nbsp;</p> <p>The cameras would eventually be used to collect information about boating behaviour in high risk areas in the Marlborough Sounds.</p> <p>That information would then be used to decide where further safety measures were necessary in the area, such as extra signage, patrols or five knot speed buoys.&nbsp;</p> <p>Further locations for the cameras, other than the initial testing sites, had not yet been confirmed.&nbsp;</p> <p>Grogan said he was open to receiving suggestions from the public about where the cameras should be set up.</p> <p>The cameras, which run from a battery and solar panel, were able to record seven days of continuous footage.&nbsp;</p> <p>Harbour Master staff had the ability to request the full footage from the cameras if there was a serious issue, such as a collision or an oil spill, Grogan said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Harbour Master team was keen to get feedback from the public on the use of the cameras, he said.</p> <p>&quot;The notion of cameras always brings up concerns of surveillance, and we're quite aware of that.</p> <p>&quot;We want to be really open with the community about what we're doing so people engage with it from the beginning.&quot;</p> <p>There would be no secret about where the cameras were placed, Grogan said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Speed was one issue Harbour Master staff would be keeping an eye on through the use of the new technology.&nbsp;</p> <p>While life jacket compliance had picked up, Grogan said speeding was one of the biggest issues on the water during the past summer.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;It's one of the insidious risks.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;It's led to fatalities in the past, including multiple fatalities.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p>Grogan told a meeting of the Marlborough District Council's environment committee on Thursday that educating people about safe speeds would be a focus next summer.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;What is required is a cultural change which is always the hardest type of change to instigate but it's the most effective.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p>A report to the committee noted 35 reports of excessive speed in December and 28 in January.&nbsp;</p>

","body":"<p>Matchbox 20 frontman Rob Thomas has issued a public apology after making a racist joke at a gig he played in Australia last night. <br /> <br /> Thomas was performing at Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, when he addressed the crowd. <br /> <br /> He joked, &quot;When you get on the plane, on your way here, you start drinking. I keep drinking until I think I'm Australian.&quot;<br /> <br /> However, he added, &quot;And then I keep drinking until I think I'm a black Australian&quot;. A quip that fell flat with the audience.&nbsp;</p> <p><iframe width=\"618\" height=\"348\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ds61rl5x7u8\" frameborder=\"0\">&amp;amp;nbsp;</iframe></p> <p>Music journalist Paul Cashmere, who was at the show said fans &quot;were not impressed&quot;.<br /> <br /> &quot;Most booed, some laughed.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It was a stupid thing for Rob Thomas, a frequent visitor to Australia, to say. He is not a first time visitor who should be ignorant of Australian history and culture.&quot;</p> <p>Thomas has since issued an apology for the comments on his Facebook page.&nbsp;</p> <p>He said: &quot;After the show in Melbourne tonight while backstage with some of my Australian friends, it was brought to my attention that I said something that is racist and insensitive.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Please understand that although it is no excuse, I was completely unaware that in Australia there is a polarising social issue happening right now involving indigenous people and alcohol.</p> <p>&quot;When I was made aware of it, the ground fell out beneath me, and I realised that people may now see me as the exact opposite of who I am.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;I'm sitting here in my hotel room completely gutted that a joke that I made was much more relevant to the times in Australia than I realised.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;I know that words are just words, but to those I offended, I deeply, DEEPLY apologise!&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;Everyone who knows me is aware that for the past 20 years I have been a fervent supporter of civil rights, so I am incredibly embarrassed by my ignorance.<br /> I feel like a fool and apologise to all Australians.&quot;</p><div id=\"fb-root\"></div><script>(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js

Her <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MovingMountainsForKristy/?fref=ts\">Facebook page</a>, which&nbsp;had more than 25,000 followers, documented the stories of many in the Australian MS community, more than 300 of which were &quot;doing exceptionally well&quot; after their stem cell transplants, she said.</p> <p>The Brewers met Cruise at an Auckland conference in 2014 and began investigating whether her solution could work for Royce Brewer.</p> <p>Kristy Cruise said her MS was in &quot;complete remission&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;I have not felt this good in years, and no longer rely on walking devices or wheelchairs at the mall.&quot;</p> <p>Cruise said the first six months after the HSCT treatment was &quot;all about recovery&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;You have a very limited immune system and are virtually unvaccinated, so the priority is good infection control, rest, gentle rehabilitation, and good nutrition.&quot;</p> <p>A spokesperson for Multiple Sclerosis New Zealand (MSNZ) said stem cell treatment, such as HSCT, &quot;looks exciting&quot;, but it was &quot;still experimental and there are significant risks&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;MSNZ advise that Stem Cell Treatments should only be done in established centres that strictly adhere to the international guidelines and preferably done in the context of a clinical trial where benefits can be measured and patients closely monitored for adverse outcomes.&quot;</p> <p>Gabby Brewer had raised about $80,000 to fund her husband's treatment, but still needed about $24,000 for a special hyperbaric oxygen chamber to help speed up his recovery.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;It's to make the most of the treatment and get the best result possible for recovery and, of course, our never-ending fear is that we never want him to get MS again . . . [but] because it's not a medical device, the medical institutes are like 'no, no, no, you can't use these chambers for that type of thing'.&quot;</p> <p>Ministry of Health chief medical officer Don Mackie said HSCT was &quot;an experimental treatment&quot; that the ministry had been watching with interest.</p> <p>HSCT was offered in New Zealand for some cancers, but was &quot;not offered or supported&quot; for auto-immune diseases such as MS.</p> <p>&quot;The ministry's advice to any New Zealander seeking any treatment overseas is to talk to their own doctor first. If an individual chooses to go ahead with the treatment, continuity of care and post-procedural follow-up are very important,&quot; Mackie said.</p>","images":[{"id":13979252,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T133249+1300","datetime_display":"13:32 21/02/2016","creditline":"SHANNON BEYNON/FAIRFAX NZ","caption":"MS sufferer Royce Brewer left

form this season to not only help the Highlanders farewell Japan-bound coach Jamie Joseph in style by defending their Super Rugby title, but to also boost his claims for a spot in the All Blacks squad.</p> <p>&quot;The main goal would be to try and win the competition again, but there are another 17 teams wanting to win the competition too, so it is going to be tough,&quot; he said.</p> <p>&quot;There's a black jersey up for grabs and there are some classy players who play for other franchises who would be just as keen to push their cases, so it is a pretty big year.</p> <p><b>READ

absence of overseas players Dan Carter and Colin Slade means there is an opportunity to push for higher honours and Sopoaga is keen to raise his game to gain selection.</p> <p>&quot;Hopefully when the season rolls around and the bright lights come on I can find another gear and go up from last year and really push my case,&quot; he said.</p> <p>&quot;Obviously there is a 10 spot up for grabs, so I will be looking to push my case as much as possible.&quot;</p> <p>The Southland Stags player is preparing similarly to last year for the 2016 version of Super Rugby which will see 18 teams battle for the trophy.</p> <p>&quot;In terms of my preparation it is a case of if it ain't broken, don't fix it,&quot; he said.</p> <p>&quot;I just kept on trucking on, listening to the trainers and the coaches and working with them as hard as I can, and at the end of the day we will see what happens come next weekend.&quot;</p> <p>He has five months to find his A-game during the Super Rugby season which starts in February and finishes in the first week of August.</p> <p>&quot;It is a long competition, so hopefully between now and finals football, I will find my best form,&quot; he said.</p> <p>The pivot is looking forward to the new season following a 40-35 win over the Waratahs in Queenstown on Friday, in what was his team's final preseason match.</p> <p>&quot;The lungs are a bit tired, but it was good fun,&quot; he said.</p> <p>&quot;The Waratahs were a tough team and we came through that one alright, looking forward to next week.&quot;</p> <p>The victory was the Highlanders' first win of their preseason campaign.</p> <p>Sopoaga knows that the Blues will be a difficult prospect when the sides meet in the opening fixture of the competition on Friday night.</p> <p>They have won all three preseason fixtures under new coach Tana Umaga.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;There is plenty to work on this week as always, but we will work on the little things,&quot; Sopoaga said.</p> <p>&quot;We are looking forward to the Blues next week, they are a pretty dangerous side.</p> <p>&quot;If we don't bring our game we could be on the end of a barrelling so we will see what happens.&quot;</p>","images":[{"id":13979118,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T130836+1300","datetime_display":"13:08 21/02/2016","creditline":null,"caption":"*","variants":[{"id":13979118,"layout":"Small

I actually thought he was joking for a full 48 hours because he carried on as normal being my partner, in every sense of the word if you get me, &amp; I just thought he was drunk. Seriously.</p> <p>&quot;But then, a few days later, I got an email from my wedding planner &amp; also the manager of the wedding venue to say he'd been in touch to cancel.....it was then we had the conversation.</p> <p>&quot;He had no explanation behind it, just that he was scared &amp; couldn't go through with it because he didn't believe in marriage, he tried to convince me it was only a piece of paper &amp; we didn't need it to be together.&quot;</p> <p>Shevlin said McGregor &quot;should have had the balls to come forward &amp; explain the situation rather than saying nothing &amp; allowing the newspapers to print stories about the wedding not going ahead&quot;.</p> <p>On Twitter, she&nbsp;has hit back at newspaper reports of the cancellation, asking &quot;Could some1 explain to me where in this quote I said that I found out because of an email &amp; had no prior knowledge?!&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p>The posted quote details how she only took the&nbsp;&quot;joke&quot; in Dubai seriously after she was called by the wedding venue manager.</p> <p>In the original blog post, Shevlin also denied rumours McGregor cancelled the wedding because she had cheated on him.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;I uncontrollably laughed at the suggestion I was unfaithful, I've never been unfaithful in my life &amp; nor would I be, it's just not in my nature,&quot; she wrote.</p>","images":[{"id":13979210,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T132309+1300","datetime_display":"13:23 21/02/2016","creditline":null,"source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"Leah Shevlin found out from her wedding venue that her fiance had called it off.","variants":[{"id":13979210,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456014189/210/13979210.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"60"}]},{"id":13979211,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T132309+1300","datetime_display":"13:23 21/02/2016","creditline":null,"source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"Leah Shevlin found out from her wedding venue that her fiance had called it off.","variants":[{"id":13979211,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456014189/211/13979211.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"621","height":"349"}]},{"id":13979212,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T132309+1300","datetime_display":"13:23 21/02/2016","creditline":null,"source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"Leah Shevlin found out from her wedding venue that her fiance had called it off.","variants":[{"id":13979212,"layout":"Strap Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456014189/212/13979212.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"298","height":"200"}]},{"id":13979214,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T132309+1300","datetime_display":"13:23 21/02/2016","creditline":null,"source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"Leah Shevlin found out from her wedding venue that her fiance had called it off.","variants":[{"id":13979214,"layout":"Defcon Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456014189/214/13979214.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"418","height":"220"}]},{"id":13979215,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T132309+1300","datetime_display":"13:23 21/02/2016","creditline":null,"source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"Leah Shevlin found out from her wedding venue that her fiance had called it off.","variants":[{"id":13979215,"layout":"ipad section splash 956:956","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456014189/215/13979215.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"956","height":"956"}]},{"id":13979216,"datetime_iso8601":"20160221T132309+1300","datetime_display":"13:23 21/02/2016","creditline":null,"source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"Footballer Allan McGregor.","variants":[{"id":13979216,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456014189/216/13979216.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"620","height":"348"}]}]},{"id":77105801,"path":"/world/south-pacific/77105801/Cyclone-Winston-Five-confirmed-dead-families-turn-to-prayer","url":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/_json/world/south-pacific/77105801/Cyclone-Winston-Five-confirmed-dead-families-turn-to-prayer","section":"National","section-home":"South Pacific","section-top-level":"World","layout":"landscape-video","title":"Cyclone Winston: Five confirmed dead, families turn to prayer","subhead":null,"alt_headline":"Prayers for the desperate","datetime_iso8601":"20160221T213504+1300","datetime_display":"21:35 21/02/2016","byline":"JEFF TOLLAN, ANNA BURNS-FRANCIS, PAUL MITCHELL AND RACHEL THOMAS","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","category_id":"Stuff","stream_id":"stuff/world/south-pacific/77105801","intro":"Desperate Fijians are kneeling in prayer in New Zealand amid efforts to help relatives affected by Cyclone Winston.","alt_intro":"As their countrymen come to terms with losing everything, Fijians in NZ are kneeling in prayer.","body":"<p>Desperate Fijians are kneeling in prayer in New Zealand amid efforts to help relatives affected by Cyclone Winston.</p> <p>&quot;A lot of what they are doing is praying,&quot;

how she had survived.</p> <p>Five people have been confirmed dead after the powerful storm struck on Saturday and overnight.</p> <p>An elderly man of Nabasovi, Koro Island, became the first victim of Winston after a roof top fell on him, the<i>&nbsp;Fiji Broadcasting Corporation (FBC)</i>&nbsp;confirmed. &nbsp;</p> <p>And Fijian media report deaths including two in Ovalau island, one from Koro Island, one from Tailevu and one from Ra province, in the north of Viti Levu.</p> <p>Winston was originally a category 5 cyclone, but has been downgraded to a category 4 storm and is moving away from Fiji after pummelling the island nation with winds of over 300kmh.</p> <p>The storm headed west away from the island but MetService was predicting it would curve and head southeast until Wednesday, then move southwards to be north of New Zealand.&nbsp;</p> <p>It's unclear what the cyclone will do beyond the forecast period.&nbsp;</p> <p>The country is under a curfew which will be lifted on Monday, at 5.30am, the National Disaster Management Office advised. All public transport services will resume at that time.</p> <p>Civil servants are being asked to report to work on Monday, while the Disaster Office will continue to monitor the situation and update the public.</p> <p>Fiji's airport at Nadi is set to reopen on Monday, and extra flights in and out of the island have been announced.</p> <hr /> <p><i><b>Are you or your family in Fiji?

Lotu-Iiga was hopeful the people of New Zealand will also pitch in to help.</p> <p>Lotu-Iiga said it was important for others wanting to help to find out what was needed most before hastily sending relief.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;It's not just about bundling things in a container and sending it over. Find out what they really need first - be that food, water clothing or shelter.&quot;</p> <p><b>EVERY ROOM SHREDDED</b></p> <p>Tweeting pictures of the damage to her Fiji home, @CaylaTikaram said they had been lucky to survive.&nbsp;&quot;Every room in the house is shredded to bits.&quot;</p> <p>With communications limited, reports of damage have been slowly emerging.&nbsp;</p> <p>At least seven outlying islands suffered severe damage, the <i>Fiji Times </i>reported, and power, water and communications have been cut to much of the country of almost 900,000 people. Some of these services are now beginning to be restored.</p> <p>&quot;Some villages have reported that all homes have been destroyed,&quot; Jone Tuiipelehaki of the United Nations Development Program tweeted late on Saturday.</p> <p>Fiji's government has declared a 30-day state of emergency amid concerns of flash flooding and mudslides.</p> <p>&quot;We certainly felt the impact of TC [tropical cyclone] Winston in Suva with destructive, howling winds and the sounds of rivets lifting from roofs a constant throughout the night,&quot; said Alice Clements of Unicef.</p> <p>&quot;It is likely that smaller villages across Fiji will have suffered the most, given their infrastructures would be too weak to withstand the power of a category 5 cyclone.</p> <p>&quot;Families may have lost their homes and crops, therefore leaving them without shelter, food and a livelihood. These families will have lost everything.&quot;</p> <p>Winston was the most powerful storm ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere.</p> <p>After twice hammering outlying islands in nearby Tonga last week, the storm re-intensified on Saturday and began to track west towards Suva, the capital of Fiji, packing winds of 230kmh, with gusts of up to 325kmh.</p> <p>Hours before the storm hit land, Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama warned the nation was facing an ordeal &quot;of the most grievous kind&quot; as tropical Cyclone Winston begins to batter the country.</p> <p>He urged Fijians to prepare themselves for a &quot;terrible event&quot;.</p> <p>Fiji-based meteorologist at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nadraki.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Na Draki</a>,&nbsp;Neville Koop, said some parts of the country &quot;are going to be very, very severely impacted&quot;.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;[Cyclone Winston] was a category 5 cyclone which is the strongest you can get and certainly the strongest I can recall in Fiji. We won't know the full details for some time.&quot;</p> <p>He feared for the people further north, whose home will have been destroyed.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;If they left their broken homes, looking for shelter, they could have found themselves in trouble.&quot;</p> <p><b>KIWIS ON THE GROUND</b></p> <p>There are 186 New Zealanders currently registered in Fiji with its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.safetravel.govt.nz/\">SafeTravel website</a>, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said. The ministry has advised against all tourist and other non-essential travel to Fiji.&nbsp;</p> <p>As the cyclone made landfall shortly after 8.30pm, NZ time, on Saturday, New Zealanders in Fiji reported flickering electricity and outages to internet.&nbsp;</p> <p>Leanne Goff lives on Denarau Island and at 10pm said: &quot;Between the wind and the torrential rain it sounds like a freight train outside.&nbsp;Latest report is the eye is supposed to hit us 3am, which feels like very long time away. That's hours and hours of sustained battering.&quot;</p> <p>The Hurricanes rugby team posted a message to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hurricanesrugby/?fref=ts\" target=\"_blank\">its Facebook page</a>, urging its Fijian supporters to stay safe.</p> <p>&quot;To all our friends from Fiji, the biggest ever storm ever in the Southern Hemisphere to looking you right in the eye. Please take cover and look after each other as this Cat 5 storm hits. From everyone at the Hurricanes and on behalf of NZ Kia kaha.&quot;</p> <p>The post has received hundreds of comments, many from those in Fiji who were sheltering from tropical cyclone Winston.</p> <p>&quot;Wind getting strong here in Nadi as well, and not feeling good knowing it's only gonna get worse,&quot; said Andrew Kang.</p> <p>Samy Lutumailagi posted &quot;We getting pounded right now.
