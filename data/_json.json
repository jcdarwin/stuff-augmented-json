No age was given.</p> <p>After twice hammering outlying islands in nearby Tonga last week, Cyclone Winston re-intensified on Saturday and began to track west towards Suva, the capital of Fiji, packing winds of 230kmh, with gusts of up to 325kmh.</p> <hr /> <p><i>Are you or your family in Fiji? Email your photos and videos to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:newstips@stuff.co.nz\">newstips@stuff.co.nz</a></i></p> <hr /> <p>The Fijian government has declared a state of natural disaster for the next 30 days.</p> <p>Hours before the storm hit land, Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama warned the nation is facing an ordeal &quot;of the most grievous kind&quot; as tropical Cyclone Winston begins to batter the country.</p> <p>He urged Fijians to prepare themselves for a &quot;terrible event&quot;.</p> <p>Forecasters were predicting that Nadi could take a direct hit from the cyclone in the next few hours.</p> <p>Fijian-born Lizann Vailasi was due to fly home to Sydney on Sunday.</p> <p>But instead she's hunkered down with her brother and his family at Pacific Harbour, south-west of Suva.</p> <p>She was mostly worried about her fellow Fijians sheltering in small towns as they wait for the worst of the wind and rain hit.</p> <p>&quot;There are thousands worse off. Fingers crossed and God willing.&quot;</p> <p>A number of airlines, including Air New Zealand, have stopped flying to Fiji until the weather clears.</p> <p><b>POWER OUTAGES ACROSS FIJI</b></p> <p>Fiji's Red Cross reported power outages across most of Fiji, including in the captial city of Suva.&nbsp;</p> <p>About 9.30pm, the eye of the cyclone made landfall over the north coast of Viti Levu, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported.</p> <p>The United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Winston was following a path that might spare Suva the full force of its winds, rated as category 5, the highest ranking on the hurricane wind scale.</p> <p>&quot;The cyclone has tracked further north than expected over the past 24 hours,&quot; the UN agency said.</p> <p>It was possible Suva may only be hit by 150kmh winds.</p> <p>Roads with trees and powerlines covering them are closed and the Fijian Government says they will not be cleared and water supplies will not be re-established until the storm passes.</p> <p><b>KIWIS ON THE GROUND</b></p> <p>New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) said 186 Kiwis had registered on its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.safetravel.govt.nz/\">SafeTravel</a>&nbsp;website as being in Fiji. It urged anyone Kiwis in the country to register on the website.</p> <p>However, as the cyclone made landfall shortly after 8.30pm, NZ time, New Zealanders in Fiji reported flickering electricity and outages to internet.&nbsp;</p> <p>Leanne Goff lives on Denarau Island and at 10pm said the cyclone was &quot;really picking up now&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;Even if I wanted too I wouldn't be able to stand up outside. Between the wind and the torrential rain it sounds like a freight train outside.&nbsp;Latest report is the eye is supposed to hit us 3am, which feels like very long time away. That's hours and hours of sustained battering.&quot;</p> <p>Tonight, the Hurricanes rugby team posted a message to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hurricanesrugby/?fref=ts\" target=\"_blank\">its Facebook page</a>, urging its Fijian supporters to stay safe.</p> <p>&quot;To all our friends from Fiji, the biggest ever storm ever in the Southern Hemisphere to looking you right in the eye. Please take cover and look after each other as this Cat 5 storm hits. From everyone at the Hurricanes and on behalf of NZ Kia kaha.&quot;</p> <p>The post has received hundreds of comments, many from those in Fiji sheltering from tropical cyclone Winston.</p> <p>&quot;Wind getting strong here in Nadi as well, and not feeling good knowing it's only gonna get worse,&quot; said Andrew Kang.</p> <p>Samy Lutumailagi posted &quot;We getting pounded right now. Neva seen this before. It's brutal man!&quot;</p> <p>Mark Wagner, a leadership coach visiting Fiji for a workshop, said winds were starting to pick up in Suva.</p> <p>&quot;[I have] never been in a cyclone before - this may not make sense but the wind actually sounds angry,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Arti Singh reported his family's neighbours in Suva had lost their roof as the wind gathered pace.&nbsp;</p> <p>Marijke Braaksma said her family, based in Nadi, had lost power.&nbsp;</p> <p>Caroline Gray said the noise at the Pearl Resort was deafening. &quot;I really feel for the locals, many of whom are spending the night in poorly constructed buildings.&quot;</p> <p>Tourists on the island of Naukacacuvu had to endure a rough three-hour ferry ride after being evacuated Saturday afternoon, but made it to Nadi before nightfall, and before Winston's full force hit.</p> <p><b>'STICK TOGETHER'</b></p> <p>The Fiji Met Service said the cyclone was expected to maintain its category five intensity - the most severe category of cyclone - as it tracked west over the centre of Fiji's main island of Viti Levu.</p> <p>The Island has a population of 650,000.&nbsp;</p> <p>Some Fijian towns had reportedly gone into virtual lock-down in preparation for the cyclone, and public transport had already been put on hold in many areas.&nbsp;</p> <p>Bainimarama urged locals to finalise their own preparations, to stick together and look after each other.</p> <p>&quot;As a nation, we are facing an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We must stick together as a people and look after each other. Be alert and be prepared,&quot; he said on the official Fiji Government Facebook page.</p> <p>&quot;I urge you all, if you haven't already done so, to finalise your own preparations to survive this terrible event. We cannot afford to be complacent.</p> <p>&quot;Make sure you have adequate food and water, flashlights, candles and lanterns in case the power supply is disrupted and a battery operated radio to keep abreast of news of Cyclone Winston's progress. &nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;I urge you to seek shelter where you are most likely to be safe and our officials can assist you.&quot;<br /> </p> <p><b>Click <a href=\"https://www.redcross.org.nz/donate/where-the-need-is-greatest/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to donate to the Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund.</b></p> <p>Unicef spokeswoman Alice Clements is based in Suva, along with about 50 other Unicef workers who have been working closely with the Fijian Government to help people prepare.&nbsp;</p> <p>She said on Saturday morning that winds were already picking up, but her team were on track to be prepared for the storm when it hit later on Saturday.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;It's being taken pretty seriously over here - it's not a happy prospect as we know the effect a category five cyclone can have on a community.&quot;</p> <p>The Ministry of Education had trained a group of teachers in how to help others respond to the storm, and Clements said it would be good to see these new skills put to use.&nbsp;</p> <p>Clements said the eye of the storm was expected to hit around midnight on Saturday.&nbsp;</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/CIMSS_Satellite\">@CIMSS_Satellite</a> shows severe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CycloneWinston?src=hash\">#CycloneWinston</a> approaching Fijiâ€™s Viti Levu with 185 mph max winds <a href=\"https://t.co/LxSGJSy6RM\">pic.twitter.com/LxSGJSy6RM</a></p>&mdash; BuzzFeed Storm (@BuzzFeedStorm) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedStorm/status/700886205097836546\">February 20, 2016</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">more stunning, ominous Himawari satellite imagery of Severe Tropical Cyclone <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Winston?src=hash\">#Winston</a> bearing down on Fiji <a href=\"https://t.co/RuZ1r9PJxB\">pic.twitter.com/RuZ1r9PJxB</a></p>&mdash; NWS OPC (@NWSOPC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NWSOPC/status/700795050330984450\">February 19, 2016</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><blockquote class=\"twitter-video\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Savusavu at 12:30pm today.

But some Washington state legislators want her in the men's room - because she was born with a penis.</p> <p>It feels uncomfortable writing about my child's genitals. But I'm not sure how else to protect her.</p> <p>And I know I've already lost some readers. People have lots of assumptions about a transgender child and their parents. Maybe radical lesbian feminists conducting gender experiments?</p> <p>But the truth is that I tried to raise my daughter as a boy. Complete with blue walls and Tyrannosaurus rex pajamas. I gave her my father's name. Took her to church on Sundays. Her siblings have had no trouble with the genders assigned them. But it just didn't work for her.</p> <p><b>READ MORE:<br /> *&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/stage-and-theatre/76736941/Transgender-love-story-comes-to-life-in-new-musical\">Transgender&nbsp;love story comes to life in new musical<br /> </a>*&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/beauty/76520054/trans-man-ashton-colby-was-a-beauty-queen\">Trans man Ashton Colby was a beauty queen<br /> </a>*&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff-nation/assignments/share-your-news-and-views/13810896/Trans-people-need-a-safe-home\">'Trans people need a safe home'<br /> </a>*&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff-nation/assignments/share-your-news-and-views/13595388/Time-for-a-transgender-education-NZ\">Time for a&nbsp;transgender&nbsp;education, NZ</a></b></p> <div class=\"fb-follow\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stuff.co.nz\" data-layout=\"standard\" data-show-faces=\"false\"> &nbsp; </div> <p>When I realised my child would only wear dresses and wanted to grow up to be a princess, I tracked down a support group for parents of gender-nonconforming kids. It turns out there's a lot of them. And the parents aren't who I imagined. Democrats and Republicans. Muslims and Catholics. Grandparents raising grandkids. Yes, there's a lesbian or two in the mix, but even they are baffled about how this happened. All these parents were scared and confused at first.</p> <p>I also talked to my pediatrician and read national psychological and medical associations' positions. If my child was having mental-health problems, I wanted to help.</p> <p>They all agreed: I need to let her be herself. If I love and support her, as a girl, she'll be happy and healthy. But if I try to force her to be a boy, she would be in a very high suicide risk category.</p> <p>So when confronted with trusting her heart and mind, or trusting her genitals, I choose her heart and mind. There was no rational choice other than to support her as a girl.</p> <p>And, of course, I want her safe from predators. I learned that transgender people are at extreme risk for sexual and physical violence. The Southern Poverty Law Centre recently declared transgender women the most victimised group in the nation. Victims, not predators.</p> <p>Examples of a transgender person, or a man pretending to be transgender, assaulting someone in a bathroom are rare. The Human Rights Campaign and the American Civil Liberties Union have pointed out that there are no documented cases in the United States.</p> <p>I have a 6-year-old. The proposed laws would require her to use the men's room. The scenario they're drumming up fear with - impersonators or actual transgender women assaulting women in bathrooms - is conjecture at best.</p> <p>These proposed bathroom restrictions make little sense. For starters, transgender people live among us and currently pee. They aren't hurting anyone.</p> <p>And consider that while some transgender people may appear transgender, many don't - for example models Geena Rocero or Ben Melzer. So, when transgender people use the restroom consistent with their identity, people who look like women use the women's room. But if we require genital-based restrictions, we would be sending transgender men, with beards and biceps, into the women's restroom.</p> <p>So, if a man eventually does decide to assault women by being deceptive about gender identity, genital-based restroom laws would ironically make it easier for him. If transgender women use the women's restroom, he would have to dress up like a woman to enter. Under the proposed system, all he has to do is claim he's a transgender man to walk into the women's restroom. No dressing up required.</p> <p>And lastly, who is going to do the genital inspections?</p> <p>This is an easy issue to distort to make Democrats look ridiculous: &quot;They want to send men into your daughter's locker room!&quot; But that fear mongering comes at a heavy price to some of the most vulnerable members of our communities.</p> <p>Please do pass and enforce laws that aggressively confront sexual harassment and assault. But don't send my daughter into the men's room in the process. She's not a threat to anyone.</p> <p><b><i>Tucker FitzGerald is a Seattle father, husband and graphic designer.

We won them by rioting,&quot; Lamusse said.</p> <p>As the police float approached them,&nbsp;several smaller groups of protesters splintered off from the main bunch and sat on the road to block the parade. Police removed the groups by force.</p> <p>A police spokesperson said no arrests had been made at the event.</p><div id=\"fb-root\"></div><script>(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_GB/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3\";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script><div class=\"fb-post\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Stuff.co.nz/videos/10153908395464268/\" data-width=\"500\"><div class=\"fb-xfbml-parse-ignore\"><blockquote cite=\"https://www.facebook.com/Stuff.co.nz/videos/10153908395464268/\"><p>#watch Thousands turn out for Auckland Pride Parade</p>Posted by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Stuff.co.nz/\">Stuff.co.nz</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Stuff.co.nz/videos/10153908395464268/\">Friday, 19 February 2016</a></blockquote></div></div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Protesters trying to pull fences down at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AucklandPride?src=hash\">#AucklandPride</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/T7HYvdBuZ4\">pic.twitter.com/T7HYvdBuZ4</a></p>&mdash; Charlotte Ryan (@CharlotteRyanNZ) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CharlotteRyanNZ/status/700924393346600960\">February 20, 2016</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>","images":[{"id":13976114,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T220819+1300","datetime_display":"22:08 20/02/2016","creditline":"LAWRENCE SMITH / FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"The Pride Parade kicks off along Auckland's Ponsonby Road on Saturday at 6pm.","variants":[{"id":13976114,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455959299/114/13976114.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"60"}]},{"id":13976115,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T220819+1300","datetime_display":"22:08 20/02/2016","creditline":"LAWRENCE SMITH / FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"The Pride Parade kicks off along Auckland's Ponsonby Road on Saturday at 6pm.","variants":[{"id":13976115,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455959299/115/13976115.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"620","height":"349"}]},{"id":13976116,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T220820+1300","datetime_display":"22:08 20/02/2016","creditline":"LAWRENCE SMITH / FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"The Pride Parade kicks off along Auckland's Ponsonby Road on Saturday at 6pm.","variants":[{"id":13976116,"layout":"Strap Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455959300/116/13976116.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"300","height":"200"}]},{"id":13976118,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T220820+1300","datetime_display":"22:08 20/02/2016","creditline":"LAWRENCE SMITH / FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"The Pride Parade kicks off along Auckland's Ponsonby Road on Saturday at 6pm.","variants":[{"id":13976118,"layout":"Defcon Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455959300/118/13976118.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"418","height":"220"}]},{"id":13976119,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T220820+1300","datetime_display":"22:08 20/02/2016","creditline":"LAWRENCE SMITH / FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"The Pride Parade kicks off along Auckland's Ponsonby Road on Saturday at 6pm.","variants":[{"id":13976119,"layout":"ipad section splash 956:956","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455959300/119/13976119.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"956","height":"956"}]}]},{"id":77097393,"path":"/sport/football/a-league/77097393/Recap-Wellington-Phoenix-v-Newcastle-Jets","url":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/_json/sport/football/a-league/77097393/Recap-Wellington-Phoenix-v-Newcastle-Jets","section":"Stuff","section-home":"A-League","section-top-level":"Sport","layout":"landscape-image","title":"Recap: Wellington Phoenix v Newcastle Jets","subhead":null,"alt_headline":"Recap: Phoenix v Jets","datetime_iso8601":"20160220T212538+1300","datetime_display":"21:25 20/02/2016","byline":null,"source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","category_id":"Stuff","stream_id":"stuff/sport/football/a-league/77097393","intro":"Newcastle Jet come from behind to beat the Phoenix 3-2.","alt_intro":"Newcastle Jets come from behind to beat the Phoenix.

The couple are full-time workers who, like many poorer New Zealanders, had deliberately taken on debt in order to improve their living standards.</p> <p>These included a $17,000 loan for a car, and a similar amount for a utility truck, through credit firms Finance Now and Instant Finance. Eaton-Luster also found herself facing an unexpected $7000 dental bill, which she paid for through her Q Card account.</p> <p>As Eaton-Luster explained, taking out loans to cover these expenses seemed to be a smart tactic, as long as no unforseen disasters occurred.</p> <p>But then a couple of unforseen disasters occurred.</p> <p>&quot;We were both in really good jobs and had knocked a fair bit off those loans,&quot; Eaton-Luster said. &quot;But about a year ago I was diagnosed with severe anxiety, and I found I could no longer cope with that role. I had to leave.&quot;</p> <p>In June Sherratt badly injured his back while at work. Although his main job is driving trucks he had also been digging trenches and had displaced some of the discs and torn a muscle - ailments that kept him out of work and on ACC for the next six months.&nbsp;</p> <p>Although they are both now back at work, the income hiatus was all it took for the interest to grow on their debts, and submerge them deeper than ever.</p> <p>Faced with the crippling commitments, the desperate pair have resorted to humour as an interim measure.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.trademe.co.nz/business-farming-industry/other/auction-1037254384.htm\" target=\"_blank\">cheeky TradeMe listing</a> will be followed by many bona fide ones, as they attempt to sell as much of their possessions - including the car - as they can to reduce the mountain.</p> <p>&quot;You will be bidding on a better future for a young couple, who have made some silly financial decisions thus far in life,&quot; the listing states. &quot;You will be helping to get them out of crippling debt ...

The filing was first reported by the Dutch magazine Quote.</p> <p class=\"indent\">The revelation comes as Google faces outrage in Europe over the small amount of tax it pays in the region. Last month, after Google reached a controversial 130 million pound (NZ$205 billion) settlement with the UK government over an audit covering 10 years of accounts, critics called the amount &quot;derisory.&quot;</p> <p class=\"indent\">The deal spawned parliamentary hearings, a government audit and scrutiny from the European Union.

Figures for 2015 revenue moved through Google's Dutch subsidiary aren't available.</p> <p class=\"center\"><b>TAX STRUCTURE</b></p> <p class=\"indent\">The company says this calculation does not reflect the methods actually used to determine its international taxes in any jurisdiction. Those methods involve transfer pricing, where payments between various international subsidiaries are used to attribute profit to the geographies where economic value is deemed to have been created.</p> <p class=\"indent\">The amount of these payments are based on estimates of what similar transactions with an unrelated company would cost. Google attributes most of the economic value of its products to its research and development operations in the US and, in the case of its overseas sales, to its Bermuda-based subsidiary, which holds the international licenses for Google's intellectual property.</p> <p class=\"indent\">The Irish tax loophole that makes the &quot;Double Irish&quot; possible was closed by the Irish parliament last year. But companies already using the structure can continue to employ it until the end of 2020.</p> <p class=\"indent\">Last week, Tom Hutchinson, Google's vice president for finance, defended the company's tax arrangements before a UK parliamentary committee. Noting that its average global tax rate for the past five years was 19 percent, Hutchinson said Google paid &quot;a fair amount&quot; of tax worldwide.</p> <p class=\"indent\">He also said that the complex structure through which Google moves most of its international profits through its Dutch subsidiary and then on to Bermuda, &quot;made sense&quot; given that the US government taxes companies on their foreign income if they bring it back into the US This gives multinationals an incentive to keep those profits overseas and in locations with little or no corporate tax.</p> <p class=\"indent\">At the end of 2015, Alphabet's foreign subsidiaries were holding $43 billion (NZ$64 billion) in cash untaxed by the US, according to the company's SEC filings.</p>","images":[{"id":13975624,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T195540+1300","datetime_display":"19:55 20/02/2016","creditline":"Reuters","caption":"Google parent Alphabet saved $2.4 billion with its 'Dutch sandwich'.","variants":[{"id":13975624,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455951340/624/13975624.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"59"}]},{"id":13975625,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T195540+1300","datetime_display":"19:55 20/02/2016","creditline":"Reuters","caption":"Google parent Alphabet saved $2.4 billion with its 'Dutch sandwich'.","variants":[{"id":13975625,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455951340/625/13975625.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"620","height":"349"}]},{"id":13975626,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T195540+1300","datetime_display":"19:55 20/02/2016","creditline":"Reuters","caption":"Google parent Alphabet saved $2.4 billion with its 'Dutch sandwich'.","variants":[{"id":13975626,"layout":"Strap Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455951340/626/13975626.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"300","height":"199"}]},{"id":13975628,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T195540+1300","datetime_display":"19:55 20/02/2016","creditline":"Reuters","caption":"Google parent Alphabet saved $2.4 billion with its 'Dutch sandwich'.","variants":[{"id":13975628,"layout":"Defcon Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455951340/628/13975628.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"418","height":"220"}]},{"id":13975629,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T195540+1300","datetime_display":"19:55 20/02/2016","creditline":"Reuters","caption":"Google parent Alphabet saved $2.4 billion with its 'Dutch sandwich'.","variants":[{"id":13975629,"layout":"ipad section splash 956:956","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455951340/629/13975629.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"956","height":"956"}]}]},{"id":77102051,"path":"/sport/golf/77102051/World-No-1-Lydia-Ko-surges-into-contention-at-the-Aus-Open","url":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/_json/sport/golf/77102051/World-No-1-Lydia-Ko-surges-into-contention-at-the-Aus-Open","section":"Stuff","section-home":"Golf","section-top-level":"Sport","layout":"landscape-image","title":"World No 1 Lydia Ko surges into contention at the Aus Open ","subhead":null,"alt_headline":"Ko moves into fourth","datetime_iso8601":"20160220T195129+1300","datetime_display":"19:51 20/02/2016","byline":"PETER THORNTON ","intro":"World No 1 Lydia Ko has surged into contention with a four-under par 68 at the Australian Open in Adelaide on Saturday.Â ","alt_intro":"World No 1 fires six birdies to be just one shot off the lead.

","body":"<p>Parents worried about their children's safety playing rugby might be advised to&nbsp;encourage them to stay well away from the scrum.</p> <p>A three-year study of the French national league, the Top 14, has found that props, hookers and scrum halves accounted for a remarkable 43 per cent of all permanent replacements made during games due to injury.</p> <p>According to specialist website&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rugbyworld.com/\">rugbyworld.com</a>, the study, commissioned by Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR) and Federation Fran&ccedil;aise de Rugby (FFR), discovered that of the 2208 physical incidents that forced players out of games between 2012-13 and 2014-15, the front row - tight head prop, loose head prop and hooker - accounted for more than a quarter.</p> <p>The study, which was released last week, pointed to hooker as being the most perilous position, tallying the most blood, neck and knee injuries, while halfbacks suffered a high number of various injuries, including muscular, knee and shoulder complaints.</p> <p>Five-eighths had the highest number of concussions and muscular injuries.</p> <p>The research found nearly half of all injuries were sustained in tackles (46.6 per cent) and the player being tackled accounted for nearly a third of them. Contrary to popular belief - and the French findings - the scrum only accounted for 2.4 per cent of injuries.</p> <p>Yet again, though, the numbers can be challenged.</p> <p>While the Australian findings state that only 4.4 per cent of injuries were concussions, an English project - the England Professional Rugby Injury Surveillance Project - published last year, concluded that, while the overall number of injuries in matches had been on a downward trend in recent times, for the third year running concussion was the most commonly reported problem.</p> <p>The report into England's Premiership competition stated that the number of reported concussions had soared by 59 per cent in 2013-14 compared to the previous season.</p><script type='text/javascript'

blistering 145.","body":"<p>It's practically Brendon McCullum's backyard, and for a tick over two hours that's just how the New Zealand captain treated Hagley Oval.</p> <p>Only a short drive from his home in his adopted city, McCullum owned the Hagley strip once again. Grown men watched in child-like wonderment and the 8000 or so guests loved every minute of this farewell party in the 30degC sunshine. Welcome to the house of Baz, double world record holder of test sixes (106) and fastest test century (54 balls). These script-writers deserve a raise.</p> <p>At stumps on day one of the second cricket test Australia were 57-1 in reply to the Black Caps first innings of 370; much more of a runfest than the tumble of wickets that beckoned in the first hour on a damp green sward. Trent Boult claimed the big scalp of David Warner with the second ball he delivered to the left-hander, but Usman Khawaja and Joe Burns saw it through to leave the test evenly poised and the hosts probably two wickets short of an ideal day in Christchurch. It still wasn't too bad.</p> <p><b>READ MORE:</b></p> <p><b>*&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/cricket/77096430/live-black-caps-v-australia-second-test-day-one\">Live: Black Caps v Australia<br /> </a></b>*&nbsp;<b><a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/cricket/77096267/black-caps-v-australia-second-test-day-one--scorecard.html\">Scorecard: Black Caps v Australia - second test<br /> </a></b>*&nbsp;<b><a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/cricket/76789740/brendon-mccullum-slash-or-burn.html\">The Brendon McCullum story: Slash or Burn</a></b></p> <p>No one really knew what to expect from McCullum in his 101st and final test, but there's something about this leafy oval. In his only other test innings here, on Boxing Day 2014, McCullum crashed 11 sixes in his 195 off 134 balls against Sri Lanka. In three one-day international knocks he averages 57 at a strike rate of 178. And on a sunny Saturday it rained sixes once again: six of them in his match-turning knock of 145 off 79 balls.</p> <p>The first, off Josh Hazlewood, saw McCullum shake off Adam Gilchrist's 100 to take sole ownership of the world test record.</p> <p>He needed some luck. It was clearly the skipper's day, right from ball two when he cleared the front leg and flayed his tattooed arms at Hazlewood, the good length delivery flying over the cordon via the edge.</p> <p>His team were 32-3 when McCullum strode out, sent in on a grassy pitch the bowlers desperately wanted to use first. Kane Williamson scrapped and edged for seven off 69 balls. Suddenly it was a different game.</p> <p>Welcomed by a rousing ovation and a baggy green guard of honour, the situation gave McCullum even more licence. With the ball nipping and leaping, attack was the best method of defence. There was also the need to get whatever runs they could as fast as possible then give the New Zealand seamers a crack with the pitch still fresh. They were 1-0 down in a two-test series and had to chase it.</p> <p>It was vintage McCullum, charging and peppering the sightscreen, or sending cover drives racing to the pickets like tracer bullets. He had luck, too, and will hand Australian fast bowler James Pattinson a beer at the end of this test when the teams share a drink.</p> <p>Pattinson shelled a very tough, low return chance from McCullum on 32.</p> <p>Then the Victorian quick's giant front boot cost him, again, after he blew two wickets for no-balls during the recent West Indies series.</p> <p>Mitchell Marsh celebrated a stunning one-handed gully grab and McCullum's head slumped, on 39. Suddenly a roar stopped him in his tracks as replays showed Pattinson's foot over the front line. Television umpire Richard Illingworth owes New Zealand a few, and this was one decision that caused him no headaches. Australia caught brilliantly, with Steve Smith taking one-handed stunners to remove Tom Latham and Williamson, but they had little to show for it.</p> <p>It soon became batting pyrotechnics in the park. McCullum and Anderson, who also arrived in scratchy form and needing a big one, put on 179 off 18.2 overs at a run rate of 9.8.</p> <p>McCullum welcomed Marsh by taking 21 off his first over, the Australian allrounder having snared his wicket five times this summer.</p> <p>Hazlewood had 1-11 off 10 overs then his next four went for 57. Marsh's eight overs cost 62 and Pattinson, eventually, took 2-81 off 15 with a solitary, costly no-ball beside his figures.</p> <p>McCullum's half-century came off 34 balls and he needed to reach three figures off 21 more deliveries to beat the record of 56 jointly held by master blaster Viv Richards and the unlikely figure of Misbah-ul-Haq, against Australia in 2014.</p> <p>It was always on, and when McCullum went 6, 4, 4, 4, off Hazlewood he got there in a canter. The crowd rose, roared, and his opposite Smith raced to shake McCullum's hand.</p> <p>New Zealand would have been happy with 250 but they were soaring past it. Anderson's 72 off 66, including four sixes of his own, provided the extra punch.</p> <p>McCullum was finally snared at deep square leg by Nathan Lyon and the crowd rose again, having been treated for 125 minutes. Then there was an eerie silence, no one quite believing what they'd just witnessed. It was just the second century by a New Zealander in his final test, after one-test wonder Rodney Redmond in 1973.</p> <p>Wicketkeeper BJ Watling, so often called on to rescue, got to enjoy himself and chimed in with 58 off 57 balls and it was 350-plus.</p>","images":[{"id":13974822,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T163945+1300","datetime_display":"16:39

It was as if nobody cared.&quot;</p> <p>Since then, each plot has been located and the name of the person buried there identified.</p> <p>Zinsli's next goal is to put a headstone or plaque on each grave.</p> <p>&quot;For me, that would give these people dignity and their families closure,&quot; he said.</p> <p>&quot;These were loved ones who were buried in unmarked graves and weren't given coffins.&quot;</p> <p>James R Hill Funeral Directors sponsored the building of the wall.</p> <p>James R Hill manager Mark Reinsfield said he was inspired to help after reading about Zinsli's cause.</p> <p>The story resonated with him because his grandfather was committed to a psychiatric hospital after suffering shell shock - what we now call post-traumatic stress disorder - after World War I.</p> <p>His first visit to the cemetery was a sombre occasion.</p> <p>&quot;I remember walking down the hill and it just felt like the land was crying out,&quot; Reinsfield said.</p> <p>&quot;There was a sadness within me ... I just knew we had to do something to memorialise these people.&quot;</p> <p>Waipa Mayor Jim Mylchreest said Zinsli had stirred the community's conscience &quot;that something was not morally right&quot; and had to be fixed.</p> <p>Also buried at the Tokanui Cemetery are servicemen from World War I and II as well as the Anglo Boer War - and at least one from the Maori Wars of the 1800s.</p> <p>Mylchreest said the cemetery was similar to overseas war graves in that it contained people who had not reached their full potential.</p> <p>&quot;These graves contain people who through no fault of their own were not able to lead full and happy lives within the community,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Changes in treatment of those with mental illnesses as well as shifts in community attitudes meant many of those buried at Tokanui would today not be institutionalised.</p> <p>&quot;Shell shock, getting pregnant out of wedlock or just being a troublesome teenager were all reasons for being committed to a mental institution in the past.</p> <p>&quot;Today must be bittersweet for the families and friends of all these people. Today we pay respect to their memory and derive inspiration from the people that have suffered a psychiatric occurrence and died in Tokanui Hospital.&quot;</p>","images":[{"id":13974691,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T160827+1300","datetime_display":"16:08 20/02/2016","creditline":"GEORGE HEARD FAIRFAX

There is no single person or group responsible. There were a number of small things that happened in a short period of time that led to this tragedy,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The family were aware of comments being posted on social media putting blame for Mitchell's death on one or two people.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;These false statements of blame are very hurtful to those people and our family. It was an accident of circumstance that involved alcohol,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>He thanked all the young people who had sat with Mitchell's twin Gerald and his sister Laura since his death.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;After today we must all move on. It will be tough to live without Mitchell in our lives. This will not be easy,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>He told mourners stories of Mitchell's adventures fishing, biking, tramping, canoeing and how he was happiest when on a farm.&nbsp;</p> <p>Mitchell had just moved out of home, got his licence and was working on a farm in Harihari.</p> <p>Ron's sister Linda said the young people who were with Mitchell at the party on the lake would relive that day for a long time.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;It is not a good way to start your adulthood. But I hope some good will come of this tragedy. Remember life is precious and death is real. Take care of each other and look after your mates. Be accountable and responsible for everything you do,&quot; she said.&nbsp;</p> <p>South Westland Area School principal Ross Brockbank spoke about Mitchell's many achievements in his short life. Mitchell was very close to his twin brother Gerald and older sister Laura, with the children growing up at the Hokitika Holiday Park, which the family owned until last year.</p> <p>He ran the ball out with the Australian team in Nelson during a game in the 2011 Rugby World Cup.&nbsp;</p> <p>In 11 years he played for Wests Rugby Club, Mitchell lost only one grand final, said&nbsp;Wests rugby club manager Jenny Keogan.&nbsp;</p> <p>Mitchell's family encouraged his friends to wear their school, rugby, Boys' Brigade or Scout uniforms or Mitchell's favourite colour, blue.&nbsp;</p> <p>Scouts and rugby club formed a guard of honour when the coffin was carried out of the service.&nbsp;</p>","images":[{"id":13974745,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T162318+1300","datetime_display":"16:23

time being.</p> <p>Lorde tweeted her support for Kesha only moments after the decision went public.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>READ MORE:<br /> *&nbsp;<a

it's very much a stepping stone for us every year towards the Olympics,&quot; Drysdale said.</p> <p>&quot;It's nice to go into the Olympic Games as the national champion, so I'm very satisfied with the way that race panned out and the result at the end of it.</p> <p>&quot;I feel very well on track, with where I am in my training - I'm very pleased with where I am six months out. I was a little bit under-done racing was, but that wasn't a big focus this year.</p> <p>&quot;I want to be the absolute best I can be in August,&quot; said Drysdale, who had surgery in December to fix problems he'd been experiencing with compartmental syndrome.</p> <p>The non-invasive surgery cuts the sheaths around the muscles in his forearms to allow greater blood flow and stop nerve problems that were hindering his grip on the sculls when involved in tough races.</p> <p>&quot;I'm still very close as where I need to be, and as showed today, I can pull out a big race. But to know there's probably a bit more there, with a bit more speed work and a bit more preparation is pleasing.&quot;</p> <p>Twigg has been quietly impressive over summer after a year off the international scene and admitted she was pleased with her progress.</p> <p>&quot;When I came back, [coach] Gary [Hay] and I set a few goals - some being on the erg, some being on the water. We've been steadily progressing, getting the speed back on the water and I'm really happy with that race today.</p> <p>&quot;I guess now there's three months to the qualification regatta, so that's the last race I'll have against women's single scullers before I line up in Lucerne.&quot;</p> <p>While Twigg has to peak earlier than August to ensure she qualifies - the top three boats in Lucerne gain places - she won't be altering her approach.</p> <p>&quot;We haven't actually changed anything really.</p> <p>&quot;You've always got to be on your toes throughout that season - of course, there's got to be slightly more of a taper into that regatta and maybe a little more speed work before that. But that's no different to how we would prepare for the nationals or a World Cup.</p> <p>&quot;All it takes is a couple of days in my opinion to get the old racing legs back.&quot;</p> <p>The premier women's eight title went to the Central RPC crew of Rebecca Scown, Ruby Tew, Kerri Gowler, Fiona Paterson, Holly Greenslade, Kirstyn Goodger, Harriett Austin, Robyn Munro and coxswain Lucy Bird in a time of 6:23.94.</p> <p>They stopped a five-year run of victories in the Max Smith Ruataniwha Trophy by Southern RPC, who took silver 5.40s back, with Auckland RPC third.</p> <p>The Rub's Rooster trophy for the premier men's eight went to Waikato RPC for the third succesive year.</p> <p>The crew of Curtis Rapley, Shaun Kirkham, Alex Kennedy, Eric Murray, Drikus Conradie, Paddy McInnes, Anthony Allen, Richard Power and cox Caleb Shepherd triumphed in 5:46.13, heading home Auckland by 3.23s with Central third.</p>","images":[{"id":13974596,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T154347+1300","datetime_display":"15:43 20/02/2016","creditline":"PHOTOSPORT","caption":"Mahe Drysdale won the premier men's single scull final at Lake Karapiro at the New Zealand championships on Saturday.","variants":[{"id":13974596,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455936227/596/13974596.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"59"}]},{"id":13974597,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T154347+1300","datetime_display":"15:43 20/02/2016","creditline":"PHOTOSPORT","caption":"Mahe Drysdale won the premier men's single scull final at Lake Karapiro at the New Zealand championships on Saturday.","variants":[{"id":13974597,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455936227/597/13974597.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"620","height":"349"}]},{"id":13974598,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T154347+1300","datetime_display":"15:43 20/02/2016","creditline":"PHOTOSPORT","caption":"Mahe Drysdale won the premier men's single scull final at Lake Karapiro at the New Zealand championships on Saturday.","variants":[{"id":13974598,"layout":"Strap Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455936227/598/13974598.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"300","height":"199"}]},{"id":13974600,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T154347+1300","datetime_display":"15:43 20/02/2016","creditline":"PHOTOSPORT","caption":"Mahe Drysdale won the premier men's single scull final at Lake Karapiro at the New Zealand championships on Saturday.","variants":[{"id":13974600,"layout":"Defcon Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455936227/600/13974600.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"418","height":"219"}]},{"id":13974601,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T154347+1300","datetime_display":"15:43 20/02/2016","creditline":"PHOTOSPORT","caption":"Mahe Drysdale won the premier men's single scull final at Lake Karapiro at the New Zealand championships on Saturday.","variants":[{"id":13974601,"layout":"ipad section splash 956:956","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455936227/601/13974601.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"956","height":"956"}]}]},{"id":77060103,"path":"/travel/destinations/nz/77060103/Hawkes-Bay-Harris-family-has-strong-bond-with-Tiger-Moths","url":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/_json/travel/destinations/nz/77060103/Hawkes-Bay-Harris-family-has-strong-bond-with-Tiger-Moths","section":"Stuff","section-home":"NZ","section-top-level":"Travel","layout":"landscape-video","title":"Hawke's Bay Harris family has strong bond with Tiger Moths","subhead":null,"alt_headline":"Tiger Moth buzzes Napier   ","datetime_iso8601":"20160220T143955+1300","datetime_display":"14:39 20/02/2016","byline":"MARTY SHARPE","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","category_id":"Stuff","stream_id":"stuff/travel/destinations/nz/77060103","intro":"A lone Tiger Moth flew over Napier in a warm, still, sunrise on Saturday.","alt_intro":"A symbol of the art deco period takes to the skies of Napier.","body":"<p>A lone Tiger Moth flew over Napier in a warm, still, sunrise on Saturday.</p> <p>Heads turned and eyes looked skyward along Marine Parade and passengers on the P&amp;O liner Pacific Pearl shielded their eyes with brochures and waved to the heavens as their ship pulled into port.</p> <p>Vintage aircraft are not an unusual sight during the city's annual art deco festival, and ZK-AJP is no stranger to these skies.

He used them to get around the farm, and also in the early days of top dressing as a way to fertilise the farm as well,&quot; he said.</p> <p>While Lewis loved the aircraft, he wasn't big on flying. He left that to his son.</p> <p>&quot;My grandfather learned to fly them and flew them all over the farm, and my father's a pilot, so I'm a third generation pilot.

After that it was released into general aviation. It's been used to tow gliders, had a canopy on it at one stage, and it's been through a few different owners, ending up with my family in the early seventies,&quot; Harris said.</p> <p>The plane will be among a large group of vintage aircraft based at the Napier aero club over the weekend.

That's all I know about him. He was a bit of a loner.&quot;</p> <p>She said he would spend a lot of time drinking by himself at the Waitomo Club, a working man's club.</p> <p>Before living in Te Kuiti, Burrett had been a longtime resident of Auckland.</p> <p><b>BURRETT 'WILL NOT TEACH AGAIN'</b></p> <p>The Education Council had Burrett struck off the teachers' register on Friday afternoon, after Burrett entered guilty pleas on 21 charges in the High Court at Christchurch. He had been a registered teacher since 1991.</p> <p>Burrett was not a practising teacher when the offences came to light, but was still on the teachers register. His only previous run-ins with the law were two driving offences in 2001 and 2007.</p> <p>The council enforced a voluntarily order where Burrett agreed not to teach when police made it aware of the sex charges in May 2015.</p> <p>Education Council teacher practice manager Andrew Greig said striking Burrett off the register sent a message to the friends and family of the young girls involved that &quot;he will not teach again&quot;.</p> <p>The school where Burrett worked as a caretaker defended its procedures.</p> <p>The board chairman said the school did as much as it could in vetting Burrett before hiring him. He was a relief teacher before he became the caretaker.</p> <p>The school felt it could not have done anything differently to discover his offending earlier. It had since made &quot;minor changes&quot; to supervision procedures during intervals and lunchbreaks.</p> <p>&quot;The school has continued to work hard to support the families involved and the wider school community,&quot; the chairman said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The introduction of the Vulnerable Children Act in 2014, after Burrett was hired, gave schools more scope to vet staff - &quot;which is good&quot;, the chairman said.</p> <p>Burrett's role as a taxi-bus driver for disabled children&nbsp;was for a different school.</p> <p>The bus company was contracted to the Ministry of Education, which police-checked him before he got the job.</p> <p>Deputy secretary Katrina Casey said the ministry also checked all records for any historic complaints received during his employment, but none were found.</p> <p>&quot;The serious criminal offending Robert Burrett has admitted is appalling and should be condemned. Our sympathy goes out to his victims and their families,&quot; Casey said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sensible Sentencing Trust spokesman Garth McVicar said it was among the worst cases he had come across.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;It's a horrific abuse of trust, involving disabled children.&quot;</p> <p>McVicar&nbsp;said people were right to wonder how Burrett could offend for more than two years, but sex offenders were &quot;very manipulative&quot;.</p> <p><b>ABUSE CONTINUED FOR YEARS</b></p> <p>The Christchurch High Court heard on Friday the abuse of the girls included rape, sodomy, forced oral sex, indecent assaults, video-taping of the offending and watching pornography. It continued for years.&nbsp;</p> <p>One girl aged 10 to 12 â€“&nbsp;the victim of repeated rapes â€“ said it happened &quot;most days, at morning tea and lunch time during school&quot;.&nbsp;</p> <p>Children saw him abusing other children. One of the girls he violated was strapped into a specialised chair and could only communicate through an electronic device.</p> <p>Burrett was employed as a school caretaker from early 2013. He was employed as a special needs bus driver from 2013 until last year.</p> <p>He repeatedly invited one girl aged between eight and 10&nbsp;years&nbsp;into his underground shed on the school grounds where he would talk to her about &quot;adult stuff&quot; and told her not to tell anybody.</p> <p>When she walked up the steps from his shed, he would touch her bottom. When he met a girl as she walked to school one day, Burrett hugged her, kissed her on the cheek, and told her to be good in class. The girl thought it was &quot;weird and gross&quot;.</p> <p>Many times, Burrett took two girls, aged nine and 10, into the shed where he committed indecencies, and raped one of the girls.</p> <p>He&nbsp;showed two girls pornographic videos during the school intervals. Objectionable images and animations involving children were found on his computer.</p> <p>A girl aged 10 to 12 was the victim of repeated rapes. He indecently touched one girl after asking her to help him pick up rubbish.</p> <p>After sexually violating a girl aged five to seven, he told her not to tell anyone or he would &quot;smash her&quot;, prosecutor Deirdre Elsmore said.</p> <p>He told one girl &quot;about sexual matters, and what sexual things he did with his wife&quot;.</p> <p>When spoken to, Burrett admitted some hugging and touching involving three girls, but then said nothing more.</p> <p>Burrett had been in custody since his arrest last year.</p> <p>Justice Cameron Mander continued suppression orders on the name of the school and the bus company on Friday, but the issue would be considered again at Burrett's sentencing on April 12.</p> <p>Changes to the Vulnerable Children Act means&nbsp;those working with children must have their checks updated every three years.</p>","images":[{"id":13974513,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T150645+1300","datetime_display":"15:06 20/02/2016","creditline":"DEAN KOZANIC / FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"sunday-star-times","source_name":"Sunday Star Times","caption":"A school bus driver has admitted sexually abusing young girls.","variants":[{"id":13974513,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455934005/513/13974513.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"60"}]},{"id":13974514,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T150645+1300","datetime_display":"15:06 20/02/2016","creditline":"DEAN KOZANIC / FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"sunday-star-times","source_name":"Sunday Star Times","caption":"A school bus driver has admitted sexually abusing young girls.","variants":[{"id":13974514,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455934005/514/13974514.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"620","height":"349"}]},{"id":13974515,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T150645+1300","datetime_display":"15:06 20/02/2016","creditline":"DEAN KOZANIC / FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"sunday-star-times","source_name":"Sunday Star Times","caption":"A school bus driver has admitted sexually abusing young girls.","variants":[{"id":13974515,"layout":"Strap Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455934005/515/13974515.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"300","height":"199"}]},{"id":13974517,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T150645+1300","datetime_display":"15:06 20/02/2016","creditline":"DEAN KOZANIC / FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"sunday-star-times","source_name":"Sunday Star Times","caption":"A school bus driver has admitted sexually abusing young girls.","variants":[{"id":13974517,"layout":"Defcon Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455934005/517/13974517.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"418","height":"220"}]},{"id":13974518,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T150645+1300","datetime_display":"15:06 20/02/2016","creditline":"DEAN KOZANIC / FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"sunday-star-times","source_name":"Sunday Star Times","caption":"A school bus driver has admitted sexually abusing young girls.","variants":[{"id":13974518,"layout":"ipad section splash 956:956","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455934005/518/13974518.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"956","height":"956"}]}]},{"id":77099454,"path":"/sport/cricket/77099454/Last-ball-run-out-shocker-costs-England-in-first-T20-v-South-Africa","url":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/_json/sport/cricket/77099454/Last-ball-run-out-shocker-costs-England-in-first-T20-v-South-Africa","section":"Stuff","section-home":"Cricket","section-top-level":"Sport","layout":"landscape-image","title":"Last ball run out shocker costs England in first T20 v South Africa","subhead":null,"alt_headline":"Last ball shocker costs England","datetime_iso8601":"20160220T142211+1300","datetime_display":"14:22 20/02/2016","byline":null,"category_id":"Stuff","stream_id":"stuff/sport/cricket/77099454","intro":"South Africa have beaten England by three wickets in the first Twenty20, running two off the last ball and surviving after Reece Topley missed an easy run out that would have kept the scores tied and forced a one-over eliminator.","alt_intro":"South Africa claim victory in the first T20 after England fielding falls apart on the last ball.","body":"<p>South Africa have beaten England by three wickets in the first Twenty20, running two off the last ball and surviving after Reece Topley missed an easy run out that would have kept the scores tied and forced a one-over eliminator.</p> <p>Instead, South Africa got the 15 runs required off the last over against Topley.</p> <p>Chris Morris hit a six and a four, and needed two off the last delivery for victory. He hit his shot straight to long-off, and Joe Root delivered a perfect throw for Topley at the bowler's end to run out non-striker Kyle Abbott as he came back for the second.

Rilee Rossouw, David Miller and David Wiese all fell leaving Morris and tailender Abbott to get 21 off the last two overs and 15 off the final over.</p> <p>Morris clubbed a four over cover off the second ball from Topley, and then launched a six over wide long-on next ball.</p> <p>It came down to the last delivery and Root, who had taken two good catches at long-on earlier, set up what should have been a straightforward run out chance for Topley at the bowler's end.

","body":"<p>The Achilles heel of journalism is that most of it doesn't matter.</p> <p>There are opinion pieces written by lunatics, election editorials ignored by everyone, press releases dressed up as news and cat videos stolen from the internet.</p> <p>And then there is the stuff that makes it all worthwhile.</p> <p>On at the cinema at the moment is a most excellent motion picture called&nbsp;Spotlight&nbsp;that shows how the&nbsp;Boston Globe's&nbsp;investigative team exposed the hierarchy of the Catholic Church for covering up for paedophile priests who preyed (rather than prayed) on the vulnerable.</p> <p>Change the accents and chuck in some kangaroos, a couple of sharks, a few surfers and a cardinal who won't come home from Rome, and the same story could be told in Australia.</p> <p>There are plenty of men of God who, if there is a hell,&nbsp;should be roasting in it. And there are plenty of cops, politicians and journalists who sat by and either were part of the conspiracy or looked the other way.</p> <p>They fiddled and kids got burned.</p> <p>Here at the open-plan offices of&nbsp;<i>The Age&nbsp;</i>we are fortunate the<i>&nbsp;Naked City</i>&nbsp;suite is close to our investigative unit that has done some wonderful exposes in recent years.</p> <p>Richard Baker and Nick McKenzie (among others) continue to show that journalism is not just about cheap headlines and expensive dinners on the Fairfax credit card.</p> <p>This is not, however, a story about McKenzie and Baker (they don't need the publicity as they have their own billboards pronouncing they shine lights in dark places, which suggests they moonlight as miners or colon surgeons).</p> <p>But it is a story about a story, just not one that ran in this publication.</p> <p>A few years ago homicide&nbsp;Detective Senior Sergeant Ron Iddlesâ€‹ asked me to join him for a charity fundraiser in Echuca (from memory I wowed the crowd with two Chopper Read anecdotes and one on how Carl Williams was shot in the guts. Classics one and all).</p> <p>On the way Ron said there was some country reporter who wanted to catch up for some advice from a professional elder.</p> <p>(I am happy to offer life tips such as; 1: Never eat meat with fruit, 2: Never give your Fairfax credit card to a Russian exchange student called Olga and 3: Never answer an email from a lawyer.)</p> <p>Iddles said her name was Tammy Mills from the&nbsp;<i>Shepparton News</i>&nbsp;and she was, well, a persistent pain in the neck.</p> <p>She kept ringing him about an unsolved murder with a desire to breathe life in a very cold case. Now to open a cold case is an expensive and protracted business â€“ essentially you have to strip the original investigation back to day one and start again.</p> <p>In the end Iddles relented and, with little confidence, agreed to have a look.</p> <p>It was the murder of Michelle Buckingham, 16, who disappeared in October 1983.</p> <p>A popular and independent kid she left Shepparton High at 15 and was looking to move out of home into shared accommodation. She was last seen walking towards the Strayleaves Caravan Park on October 21.</p> <p>The investigation was hampered from the start. Her parents, Elvira and Geoff, were divorced and there was some confusion where their daughter was supposed to be staying when she disappeared.</p> <p>This meant she wasn't reported missing until October 28. Her body was found dumped in a roadside drain near Violet Town Road, Kialla East, on November 7. She died of multiple stab wounds.</p> <p>There were false leads and near breakthroughs but eventually the case faded away until Mills decided Michelle deserved more.</p> <p>She contacted Iddles, then head of the cold case unit in Melbourne. Her idea was to bombard Shepparton with the story in the hope someone with inside knowledge would finally come forward.</p> <p>It was a million to one chance but sometimes long shots actually win.</p> <p>&quot;I kept telling her we didn't have the staff or resources to work on it but she kept calling me and kept asking questions. Eventually I agreed to reopen the case, and that if she wrote about it, any leads would be followed up,&quot; he says.</p> <p>And she did, writing a comprehensive series for the&nbsp;<i>Shepparton News</i>&nbsp;in August 2012 that covered the murder, the initial investigation and the aftermath. It was a series that lasted five days â€“ an old-fashioned newspaper campaign without a cat video in sight.</p> <p>(Just weeks earlier she was writing about five runaway sheep that included puns of which she should be deeply ashamed â€“ such is the life of a country reporter).</p> <p>Police received 30 tips but one intrigued Iddles. It was from a man who agreed to meet the veteran detective at the Shepparton East Football Club&nbsp;ground.</p> <p>The witness had read the series but it was the photo of Michelle's mother, Elvira, on page one that pushed him to speak.</p> <p>His name was Norman Gribble and&nbsp;he would tell Iddles the secret he had kept for decades.</p> <p>Someone he knew had confessed to the murder and that someone was his brother-in-law, Steven Bradley.</p> <p>According to Gribble the day after Michelle was murdered a distressed Bradley confessed he had killed.</p> <p>Bradley told Gribble he and &quot;mates&quot; Rodney Butler and Trevor Corrigan went to the caravan park where they picked up Michelle.</p> <p>He said when she refused to have sex the three of them stabbed her to death in his car at the nearby Pine Lodge Hotel car park.</p> <p>Gribble told Iddles he actually bandaged the cut hand of his brother-in-law â€“ an injury he sustained while killing the teenager.</p> <p>At first he wanted to stay in the background but eventually Iddles persuaded Gribble to go on the record. He would become the brave and unshakable witness who helped convict his wife's brother.</p> <p>He was prepared to risk fracturing his own family to help a grieving one.</p> <p>&quot;Without Tammy and Norm Gribble this case was going nowhere,&quot; Iddles maintains.</p> <p>&quot;The bottom line is that if she wasn't passionate and persistent about writing about Michelle and getting us involved it would still be unsolved.&quot;</p> <p>At the Echuca charity function I watched Iddles call Tammy from the crowd to tell the locals that because of her work he expected to solve a local mystery.</p> <p>He then held her hand in the air as if she had won a heavyweight fight. But the bout was far from over.</p> <p>Bradley may have been distressed straight after the murder but he was sufficiently composed to cover his tracks. He sold his HQ Holden murder car and left Shepparton to return only rarely.</p> <p>Iddles interviewed Bradley several times and on each occasion his version changed. At one time he admitted to having a repeated nightmare where a blonde girl sat on his chest making it hard for him to breathe. In the dream he carried a knife.</p> <p>At first he denied, then he couldn't remember and finally told a story that would not be believed by a Supreme Court jury.</p> <p>In May 2014 he was charged, extradited from Brisbane and eventually committed for trial.</p> <p>The publicity, the investigation and the arrest showed the devastated Buckingham family that Michelle had not been forgotten.</p> <p>But days before the trial was to begin Elvira suffered a massive heart attack. She would not live to see her daughter's killer convicted.</p> <p>Butler and Corrigan would give evidence under oath that they weren't involved, claims Supreme Court Justice Robert Osborn specifically dismissed finding, &quot;I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was a killing carried out jointly with Rodney Butler and Trevor Corrigan.&quot;</p> <p>There remains insufficient evidence to charge the two but before they slink back into obscurity to tell their friends and family they are innocent just remember this.</p> <p>The Supreme Court says you did it. It is there on the record. You may think it will go away but it won't. Just like Bradley it will haunt your dreams and as you get older and frailer it will consume you.</p> <p>As part of the plea Bradley was portrayed as a failed worker, failed partner, failed father and a mediocre crook. He found his time in Pentridge Prison particularly &quot;harrowing&quot;.</p> <p>He may have wasted his own life, but he stands condemned for taking Michelle's.</p> <p>As Justice Osborn said:&nbsp;&quot;You have never demonstrated any real remorse for the killing or accepted responsibility for what you did.&quot;</p> <p>On December 22 â€“ more than 32 years after Michelle was attacked in a car and repeatedly stabbed in the back â€“ Bradley was sentenced to 27 years with a minimum of 21.</p> <p>He will remain an insignificant man, violent and vindictive, who will only be remembered for his monstrous and cowardly act.</p> <p>Every generation thinks the one before is inflexible and the one that follows is shallow and in a newsroom cynicism can erode optimism like damp rot in winter.</p> <p>The Buckingham case shows the nature of journalism may have changed but the quality has not. (Mills has now moved to&nbsp;<i>Fairfax Media&nbsp;</i>as an ace crime reporter.)</p> <p>So thank you, Tammy, for reminding us that every now and again what we do actually matters.</p> <p>But if you have read this far you already know that.</p>","images":[{"id":13974111,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T135413+1300","datetime_display":"13:54 20/02/2016","creditline":"Ray Sizer / Shepparton News","caption":"Elvira Buckingham in a photograph taken shortly after charges were laid over her daughter's death.","variants":[{"id":13974111,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455931010/111/13974111.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"59"}]},{"id":13974112,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T135413+1300","datetime_display":"13:54 20/02/2016","creditline":"Ray Sizer / Shepparton News","caption":"Elvira Buckingham in a photograph taken shortly after charges were laid over her daughter's death.","variants":[{"id":13974112,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455931010/112/13974112.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"620","height":"348"}]},{"id":13974113,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T135414+1300","datetime_display":"13:54 20/02/2016","creditline":"Ray Sizer / Shepparton News","caption":"Elvira Buckingham in a photograph taken shortly after charges were laid over her daughter's death.","variants":[{"id":13974113,"layout":"Strap Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455931010/113/13974113.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"300","height":"199"}]}],"galleries":[{"id":13974103,"url":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/_json/13974103/How-a-young-reporter-helped-solve-a-murder-case","layout":"Image Gallery","section":"Stuff","section-home":"Australia","title":"How a young reporter helped solve a murder case","datetime_iso8601":null,"datetime_display":"23:29 20/02/2016","intro":null,"images":[{"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T135336+1300","datetime_display":"13:53 20/02/2016","caption":"Michelle Buckingham was murdered when she was 16, in 1983.","variants":[{"id":13974099,"layout":"1024 Landscape","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455931010/099/13974099.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"615","height":"768"}]},{"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T135336+1300","datetime_display":"13:53 20/02/2016","creditline":"Ray Sizer / Shepparton News","caption":"Elvira Buckingham in a photograph taken shortly after charges were laid over her daughter's death.","variants":[{"id":13974100,"layout":"1024 Landscape","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455931010/100/13974100.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"1022","height":"683"}]},{"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T135336+1300","datetime_display":"13:53 20/02/2016","creditline":"generagos","caption":"One of the Shepparton News' front pages about the Michelle Buckingham case.","variants":[{"id":13974101,"layout":"1024 Landscape","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455931010/101/13974101.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"616","height":"768"}]},{"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T135336+1300","datetime_display":"13:53 20/02/2016","creditline":"Julie Mercer","caption":"Veronika Taylor, sister of Elvira Buckingham, hugs former Shepparton News reporter Tammy Mills.","variants":[{"id":13974102,"layout":"1024 Landscape","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455931010/102/13974102.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"1018","height":"683"}]}]}]},{"id":77098615,"path":"/sport/football/a-league/77098615/Contract-misprint-nets-Hull-Citys-Jimmy-Bullard-an-extra-34-000-a-week","url":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/_json/sport/football/a-league/77098615/Contract-misprint-nets-Hull-Citys-Jimmy-Bullard-an-extra-34-000-a-week","section":"Stuff","section-home":"A-League","section-top-level":"Sport","layout":"landscape-image","title":"Contract misprint nets Hull City's Jimmy Bullard an extra $34,000 a week","subhead":null,"alt_headline":"'I'm celebrating to this day'","datetime_iso8601":"20160220T134235+1300","datetime_display":"13:42 20/02/2016","byline":null,"source_code":"reuters","source_name":"Reuters","category_id":"Stuff","stream_id":"stuff/sport/football/a-league/77098615","intro":"Former Hull City midfielder Jimmy Bullard, who is now retired, says the club \"changed his life\" by paying him up to an extra Â£15,000 or Â£16,000 (NZ$33,000 or NZ$34,500) a week by mistake.","alt_intro":"Professional footballer was paid up to $35,000 a week too much for four years.","body":"<p>Former Hull City midfielder Jimmy Bullard, who is now retired, says the club &quot;changed his life&quot;

A British exit - popularly known as &quot;Brexit&quot; - is strongly opposed by all EU leaders, Cameron included, and it could have disastrous consequences for the future of a body that has defined Europe's post-war order.</p> <p>Cameron said later in a news conference that the package of EU reforms was &quot;enough&quot; for him to recommend that Britain remain in the union. It gives Britain &quot;the best of both worlds,&quot; he said.</p> <p>But European leaders who gathered this week in Brussels were reluctant to give Cameron the sort of wide-ranging concessions he previously said he needed to sell continued EU membership to his increasingly populist-minded voters. A deal that was supposed to be celebrated at an &quot;English breakfast&quot; Friday morning instead was left undone through more than 24 hours of nearly continuous talks in which both sides struggled to bridge wider-than-expected gaps.</p> <p><b>READ MORE:<br /> * <a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/europe/75290824/uk-prime-minister-david-cameron-suggests-wants-eu-referendum-next-year\" target=\"_blank\">Is Britain set to vote on Europe exit?</a></b></p> <div class=\"fb-follow\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stuff.co.nz\" data-layout=\"standard\" data-show-faces=\"false\"> &nbsp; </div> <p>A breakthrough finally came as European leaders dined over veal fillets and polenta late Friday evening. In the end, Cameron received concessions that amounted to far less than the fundamental renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU that he had promised. But he was expected to declare victory nonetheless.</p> <p>Still, it remains an open question whether Cameron received enough to sway his electorate, which polls show is nearly evenly divided on the question of whether to stick with the EU. Brexit advocates insist that the country is being weighed down by its ties to the continent, and particularly by the open borders to European immigration that are required under EU treaties.</p> <p>The most controversial element of Cameron's renegotiation demands was a proposal to limit government benefits for workers who move to Britain from elsewhere in the EU. Eastern European countries, which are the source of much of that migration, waged a tough battle to water down any changes.</p> <p>The deal was originally supposed to be sealed Friday over breakfast, with EU leaders gathered around a table piled high with bacon and beans.</p> <p>But as negotiations that began on Thursday afternoon hit a series of snags overnight, plans for breakfast were pushed back to an English brunch. Then lunch. Then high tea. Late Friday, the presumably famished leaders finally sat down to dinner - and launched into another long night of talks.</p> <p>Seated around the elaborate ballroom table, Cameron wore white shirt-sleeves alongside his suit-jacket-clad counterparts. The mood appeared jovial, though that masked some of the bitter division that defined the negotiations.</p> <p>Cameron is expected to use the fraught nature of the talks to demonstrate that he battled to the end with European counterparts to get the best possible deal for Britain.</p> <p>Experts said there was undoubtedly an element of theatrics involved in the through-the-night negotiations.</p> <p>&quot;The negotiations have to be difficult to create the sense of having gained something big,&quot; said London School of Economics political analyst Tony Travers.</p> <p>But already on Friday, British Euroskeptics were lining up to proclaim the long and protracted talks as Exhibit A in their portrayal of the EU as a hopelessly dysfunctional institution that is beyond hope for serious reform.</p> <p>Nigel Farage, leader of the anti-EU UK Independence Party, wrote on Twitter that Cameron has &quot;gone from talking about fundamental change to holding out a begging bowl for minor concessions.&quot;</p> <p>Indeed, the changes agreed on Friday would not fundamentally alter the EU. But the stakes are high, nonetheless: Cameron has long said he believes that Britain should stay in the EU. only if the union can be reformed to better serve British interests. The prime minister will now have to take the concessions won this week, and make the case to British voters that they should stick with the union in a referendum widely expected this June.</p> <p>European officials have uniformly said they want to keep Britain in the club. But they have also bridled at what many regard as a British attempt to blackmail the union into giving the United Kingdom a special deal.</p> <p>In a case laid out last year, Cameron proposed four changes: an exemption from Europe's vow to pursue &quot;ever-closer union&quot;; protections for members that do not use the euro; a national veto over EU legislation; and, most controversially, permission to limit benefits paid to immigrants from within the EU.</p> <p>All four measures would loosen the bonds of continental integration, and each proved a difficult sell to reach the unanimous agreement that the EU requires. The French pushed back against attempts to weaken financial regulations. Eastern Europeans called foul on benefit restrictions. The Germans fretted that abandoning ever-closer union could scupper the European project.</p> <p>Other variables also came into play, as well. Before signing off on a deal, Greek negotiators reportedly sought a promise that the EU would not shut the country's northern border to refugees. Such a move, which several EU members have advocated, could effectively trap thousands of asylum seekers in Greece and prevent them from reaching the countries in northern Europe where they hope to settle.</p> <p>Despite the obstacles, some EU leaders were outspoken in arguing that the EU would suffer if Britain ends up bolting from a union that has been decades in the making.</p> <p>&quot;We all, of course, pursue our national interests. But we should also bear in mind that should Britain leave, we all get nothing,&quot; said Estonian prime minister Taavi Roivas as he arrived for the Friday talks.</p> <p>European leaders are mindful that a British exit could be just the start of a broader unravelling, with Euroskeptic forces in their own countries likely to be emboldened if one of the cornerstones of the EU project departs.</p> <p>Cameron was expected late Friday to soon return to London for the official launch of the campaign. But even before the negotiations were complete, he was facing defections. One of the most senior members of his cabinet, Michael Gove, will join the &quot;out&quot; campaign, the BBC and other media outlets reported Friday evening.</p> <p>Most of the government's other top officials were expected to stick with the prime minister and support the &quot;in&quot; campaign. But some leading Conservatives have yet to show their cards, including London Mayor Boris Johnson, who would give &quot;out&quot; a charismatic potential leader if he ends up siding with Brexit.</p> <p>The date for the referendum is widely expected to be June 23, though the prime minister technically has until the end of 2017 to hold a vote that he promised during last year's general election.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I have negotiated a deal to give the UK special status in the EU.

That (punching) is definitely not me.&quot;</p> <p>Kaino confirmed his lash out with his hand had not been an intentional strike.</p> <p>&quot;My arm was trapped, I went to release it and got him flush. It's definitely not the way I play the game and how I do things. I went and said sorry to my poor mate and we'll see what happens now.&quot;</p> <p>Kaino is known as a hard but exceedingly fair player and has stayed largely out of trouble during an outstanding career that has seen him earn 68 caps (including two World Cup victories) for the All Blacks and log 83 caps for the Blues.</p> <p>The Blues would not want to lose him for their season opener, though they do have the luxury of rising star and sevens sensation Akira Ioane lurking in their loose forward contingent.</p> <p>Ioane has not appeared in the Blues' pre-season because of sevens commitments and then a slight hamstring strain that kept him out of the hitout against the Chiefs.</p> <p>Chiefs coach Dave Rennie described Kaino's strike on Manu as &quot;out of character&quot; and added: &quot;If he had his opportunity he would probably take it back.&quot;</p> <p>Kaino, though, was rapt with the way his team rallied after he left the field. Down a man, the Blues scored the last two tries of the game to close out their pre-season with a 3-0 record.</p> <p>&quot;Thet most impressive thing was how the boys reacted under pressure and adversity, and the energy and physicality they brought,&quot; Kaino said. &quot;I thought a lot of the senior guys like Charlie [Faumuina] and James Parsons really stepped up.

We parents are just plain lazy.</p> <p>Oh, we have plenty of excuses, of course.</p> <p><b>#1 &nbsp;It's too far.</b>&nbsp;In areas with growing populations like Auckland and the Bay of Plenty, there are more schools than there were a generation ago. The number in Auckland, for instance, has grown from 518 in 1996 to 562 now. That means more of us in these areas are within easy walking distance of our local school than ever before.</p> <p><b>#2 &nbsp;It takes too much time.</b>&nbsp;With all of us driving to work, and dropping off the kids on the way, many of our roads are chocka. A massive 1.3 million of us hopped in a car or truck to get to work on Census Day 2013, and many dropped off the kids at school. Because the streets are so busy, working-age adults are spending an average eight hours a week in the car â€“ up 25 per cent. Between us all, that's 1.2 billion hours a year. This means the school run in a car is taking longer than ever, but walking and cycling speeds haven't been affected by the growing car traffic congestion.</p> <p><b>#3 &nbsp;Attackers lurk in waiting.</b>&nbsp;This is of no consolation to the family of the 5-year-old girl grabbed from the streets of Palmerston North last week. but you can count on your fingers the number of children kidnapped by strangers.&nbsp;Kirsa Jensen. Teresa Cormack. Louisa Damodran ...&nbsp;&quot;Situations like this are incredibly rare in New Zealand,&quot; Manawatu police commander Inspector Sarah Stewart said of the Palmerston North abduction. By comparison, there's a child killed in a car crash every month, on average. Which brings us to the final excuse.</p> <p><b>#4 &nbsp;The traffic is too dangerous.</b>&nbsp;Yes, it's true, with more cars on the roads, children are more vulnerable. But there's a reason there are more cars on the roads before 9am and after 3pm&nbsp;â€“ it's because we're all doing the school run.</p> <p>I talked this weekend to Tracey Gibb, whose son Joshua was killed by a van in 2011 when he was cycling to school. It really wasn't the driver's fault: there was no pedestrian crossing so the 12-year-old tried to turn across the busy Napier road at rush-hour.</p> <p>She has a message for families. &quot;Walk with them at first,&quot; she says. &quot;Make sure your children have the road skills.</p> <p>&quot;But don't be afraid to let them be healthy, to let them be kids. It's importaant for them to be independent, growing up. We don't want to wrap them up in cotton wool.&quot;</p> <p>Coroner Christopher Davenport recommended a proper pedestrian crossing outside the school on Guppy Rd where Josh died. Instead, Napier City Council has gone further. After talking with Tracey, the council has set in place lower speed zones, with flashing signs, outside every school in the city.</p> <p>We applaud this. If parents are to feel safe about their kids walking and riding to school, councils need to do their bit to set in place some basic traffic controls.</p> <p>Today, we launch&nbsp;our Foot It campaign, encouraging families to get active on the school run. Leave the car in the garage, and walk, ride or scoot to school. We're writing to schools with advice and encouragement around setting up walking buses.</p> <p>And we're asking the country's 68 local councils to create and enforce lower speed zones outside every school. Most, it seems, still don't have them.</p> <p>I'll be walking my 6-year-old to school on Monday, for a change. Go on, join me.</p> <p>We can make excuses. Or we can make a difference for our kids.</p><p> </p>","images":[{"id":13973719,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T125135+1300","datetime_display":"12:51 20/02/2016","creditline":"CLINTON LLEWELLYN / FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"sunday-star-times","source_name":"Sunday Star Times","caption":"Tracey Gibb's son Joshua Bennie died in 2011 after being hit by a van while cycling to school.

But on the balance of probabilities, it's my opinion that the evidence does rather point to David. What do you think?</p> <p>The first jury found him guilty and the judge sent him to prison, where he spent the next 13 years. A retrial was eventually ordered and a second jury said not guilty in 2009. That's nearly seven years ago.</p> <p>Courts don't find people innocent â€“ they find them either guilty or not guilty. I have followed the excellent work over the years of <i>Press</i> journalist Martin van Beynen â€“ who sat through every minute of the retrial â€“ and it's clear&nbsp;that his opinion is&nbsp;that David did it.&nbsp;</p> <p>That's really important. He says the police case was sloppy but&nbsp;he thinks&nbsp;the evidence against David was overwhelming. David's fingerprints are all over the weapon, the .22 rifle ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ his father Robin Bain's are not. Not one. Then there's the bruises and blood on David's face and torso and the 20-minute delay in ringing police after&nbsp;&quot;finding&quot;&nbsp;the bodies, the list goes on.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet the David Bain case has New Zealand truly divided.&nbsp;Polls show half the country think he's the killer, the other half think he's been genuinely maligned and is the innocent young boy in the very bad jersey.&nbsp;</p> <p>Which brings me to the compensation claim. I believe this Government is biased against David Bain. I believe the decision makers believe David Bain killed his family. Like every other New Zealander, these ministers have read and followed the trials for decades. It's been impossible to ignore.&nbsp;</p> <p>They have been unable to divorce themselves from their personal views. It's completely unprofessional. For that reason, Bain can not get a fair and independent compensation hearing under this Government.&nbsp;</p> <p>It's impossible and we've seen that. Bain's claim needs to be heard by a truly independent panel away from the clutches of Government. And this time the findings can't be ignored because they don't gel with the ministers think.&nbsp;</p> <p>But that's not how it works here. The decision is highly political, not legal. This Cabinet doesn't want to pay him a cent because they don't believe he's innocent.</p> <p>Ministers have spent millions of dollars shopping around for a report that fits their view. The indisputable fact is that Bain was found not guilty in the retrial.&nbsp;</p> <p>You might not like that decision, but the justice system stops being a system when politicians can pick and choose the verdicts they approve of. You can't re-try by shopping around for a judge to write the report you want.</p> <p>And stop and wonder just for a minute if Bain didn't do it: the agony of finding his family slaughtered, being convicted, the torment of 13 years in prison and waiting the past seven years for a resolution.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Binnie report said Bain was likely innocent â€“ the&nbsp;government&nbsp;didn't like it â€“ it was binned. Now this latest leaked Callinan report suggests Bain is not innocent beyond reasonable doubt. That fits the Government's take. That's more like it.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Government's management of the process has been simply woeful. Bain was found not guilty at trial. He can't do anything more. The legal processes are exhausted.&nbsp;</p> <p>This has dragged on far too long and it needs to be settled. In my opinion Bain deserves compensation. This Government keeps changing the rules of the game to prevent Bain from his payday. The whole thing has lacked transparency.</p> <p>And let's be really clear, it's not about the money: $2 million (ish) is not even a drop in the bucket when you look at how much we spend every year on the justice system. Lawyer and former head of the Criminal Bar Association, Gary Gotlieb, said this week that Bain deserved compensation.&nbsp;</p> <p>This mess was created under&nbsp;John Key and Judith Collins' watch and now&nbsp;Justice Minister, Amy Adams, is in the hot seat.

He led his team in the latter three of those categories.</p> <p>But Vukona's influence extends well beyond sheer numbers. He brought the attitude and the intensity from the off. He said to his team-mates, &quot;this is our time of the year&quot; and he went out from the opening tap and got hands on ball and made huge plays to get the good ship Breakers rolling along.</p> <p>He also brought defence. Daniel Kickert has been a strong performer for Melbourne this season, with the ability to knock down the three ball at nearly 50 percent and also go inside with his 2.08m length. On Thursday night he had just six points and two rebounds, a non-factor principally because of Vukona's steely presence on defence.</p> <p>&quot;One of the greatest, one of the all-time best,&quot; said assistant coach Paul Henare when asked to rate Vukona's performance.</p> <p>&quot;He was outstanding from the tip, just unbelievable. He was over every loose ball. Every aspect of the game, he was all over it. He was just outstanding.&quot;</p> <p>And that from a man not prone to hyperbole.</p> <p>Added head coach Dean Vickerman: &quot;Mika really set the tone in the first quarter with his ability to grab offensive rebounds, get deflections and run the break. He was absolutely everywhere.&quot;</p> <p>Vukona's performance was all the more remarkable in that it came on the back of a largely unspectacular regular season where he struggled for rhythm and consistency and was dogged by a nagging hamstring injury.&nbsp;</p> <p>But it is his warrior mentality that sets him apart when the playoffs start. Remember 2011 when he played that must-win semifinal in Perth on one leg (after sustaining a serious knee injury in the opener) and grabbed 10 rebounds to keep the charge to the first title alive? His recovery in just a few days between games was nothing shy of a medical miracle.</p> <p>But that's Vukona in a nutshell. He is as mentally strong an athlete as there is in New Zealand sport. And he understands that in the playoffs the ability to impose your will, your way, on your opponents takes you a long way to victory.</p> <p>&quot;He just leads us in so many ways,&quot; adds Henare.</p> <p>&quot;As frustrating as it is for coaches sometimes to have those ups and downs throughout the regular season, to be able to count on someone like him, and several others, in crunch time is just fantastic.</p> <p>&quot;That's why he's our captain, our leader, and why he has been such an inspiration on any team he has been part of for a long, long time.&quot;</p> <p>It's why the Breakers will again look to their mighty power forward to again set the tone tonight as they look to extend a remarkable post-season record.</p> <p>The last time the Breakers lost in the playoffs was April 20, 2012, when they were pipped 87-86 by the Wildcats in a grand final thriller in Perth to send the series back to Auckland for a decider. (The Breakers won that, for their second straight title).</p> <p>Since then this remarkable Kiwi franchise has won 10 straight playoff games in the ANBL, annexing those four titles in the previous five seasons. They are also on the verge of a record ninth consecutive series victory.</p> <p>But they must all take a leaf out of their warrior leader's book, flex those muscles, and steel those nerves, for Melbourne will surely be coming with the kitchen sink as they look to keep their season alive. If the visitors can marry their undoubted talent with a little more hustle and bustle, they will be serious threats to keep this thing alive.</p> <p>The recipe for the Breakers remains the same as game one: dominate the boards, guard the three-point line and go for the jugular against United's flimsy interior defence. Cedric Jackson needs to stay in attack mode, Corey Webster stay ready for a sliver of daylight, Tom Abercrombie continue to pick his moments to just jump over people and Alex Pledger, Charles Jackson and Tai Wesley keep hammering the rim.</p> <p>At 1-0 up, it's a game tailor-made for the mentally strong. All the pressure is on the opposition. All the desperation is with them. Take their best shots early, stand up and send a message back to them, and that emotional energy can drain quickly.</p> <p>Luckily for the Breakers their inspirational leader has that tougness and tenacity in his DNA.</p> <p><i>* Tipoff tonight is 7.30pm.

They want beautiful, aspirational fashion imagery. They want someone in their age and shape who they can relate to.&quot;</p> <p>It also makes economic sense. Figures from the Centre for Economics and Business Research show that 50-plus women spend &pound;6.7 billion (NZ$14.48 b) a year on fashion - more than 4 per cent of the market and growing at 1 per cent a year.</p> <p>For JD Williams, this means a new business opportunity.</p> <p>But what of the clothes?</p> <p>Featuring models from Mrs Robinson Management, including model/racehorse trainer Tracey Bailey and actress/model Tanya Drouginska, the show practised what it preached.</p> <p>There were elasticated waist trousers (72 per cent of over-fifties value comfort when they dress) but also some very chic wide-leg charcoal grey ones. Ten points for those.</p> <p>Everything had a sleeve, including an on-trend full-length floral boho dress, because nine out of 10 women over 50 want some arm coverage.</p> <p>And, this being a winter show, there were well-tailored coats with a ruffle here, a flourish there. The standout was by London College of Fashion student Menge Wu: a sporty parka with a generous shawl collar.</p> <p>For show stylist Caroline Baker, 70, the collection was all about inspiring those older women who don't want to look like they're old.</p> <p>&quot;Helen Mirren looks great on the red carpet,&quot; she says, &quot;but what about role models for everyday style? I love to see women looking cool. Where are they?&quot;</p> <p>Model Marie Helvin agrees. &quot;The area where women over 50 are most ignored is in fashion magazines and advertising,&quot; she says.</p> <p>Helvin admits to a Net-A-Porter habit for well-tailored separates.</p> <p>&quot;I buy pencil skirts and well-cut trousers from Net and supplement with high-street buys. I get all my tops from H&amp;M. But other high-street shops need to re-focus.&quot;</p> <p>Helvin's right. But with a demographic this powerful and vociferous demands for diversity coming from the fashion buying public, one hopes the high street will respond to the needs of the over-fifties.</p> <p>And 50-Plus Fashion Week, albeit in a tokenistic way, might be the start of very necessary change.</p>","images":[{"id":13972996,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T102705+1300","datetime_display":"10:27 20/02/2016","creditline":"David M.

to Australia, which essentially means holding down a well-paid job, paying taxes and meeting health and security requirements.</p> <p><b>When does the new category start?</b></p> <p>Next year, from July 1.</p> <p><b>Why is this happening?</b></p> <p>Well, New Zealand and Australia are special friends.</p> <p>Prime Minister John Key is even breaking with tradition for visiting dignitaries and staying with Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull and his wife in their Sydney mansion.</p> <p><b>There's history here isn't there?</b></p> <p>For years, Kiwis in Australia have enjoyed <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1314/QG/NZinAust\" target=\"_blank\">special access</a> to Australia, a country with a stern border policy.</p> <p>New Zealanders are automatically granted the right to live and work there, use the public health system and so on.</p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of Kiwis have crossed the ditch to set up shop in Aussie. But not everyone who settles is entitled to the same rights as naturally-born Australians. Kiwis with SCVs cannot vote, access student loans or claim benefits (since 2001).</p> <p>Before 2001, Kiwis were essentially residents if they lived in Australia, but there were controversies, mainly around migrant Kiwis and Pacific Islanders using the system as a bit of a backdoor and, in some cases, adding to a burden on the social security system.</p> <p>When the new visa was created, anyone who arrived after February 2001 was classed as &quot;non protected.&quot;</p> <p>This means Kiwis can still live and work indefinitely in Australia but they are unable to apply for benefits, unless they become a resident.</p> <p>There have been problems with the denial of some rights for Kiwis in Australia, concerns about a permanent <a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/australia/7909670/Light-on-Australias-second-class-Kiwis\" target=\"_blank\">second class</a>, for example, and reports of high levels of <a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/australia/8542785/Homeless-Kiwis-live-under-a-Sydney-bridge\" target=\"_blank\">homelessness</a> among New Zealanders in Aussie.</p> <p>And, recently, there has been an increase in the number of Kiwis with criminal records deported from Australia. This is another, but related, issue.</p> <p><b>How many people are we talking about?</b></p> <p>In 2013, the Australian government estimated there were 640,770 Kiwis living in Australia. Of these, it has been estimated anywhere from 150,000 to 280,000 hold SCVs.</p> <p>The Australian government estimates between 60,000 and 70,000 New Zealanders who hold post-2001 SCVs&nbsp;will be&nbsp;eligible&nbsp;at July 1. That number will continue to grow as more New Zealanders hit the five-year threshold and meet the criteria.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>So, how will it work exactly?</b></p> <p>This is where it gets a little complicated.</p> <p>A new visa scheme will be run by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.</p> <p>A &quot;pathway to citizenship&quot; option will be available within the &quot;<a href=\"https://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Visa-1/189-\" target=\"_blank\">skilled independent</a>&quot; category of the general skilled migration (GSM) visa, a class for people under the age of 50.</p> <p><b>What about income?</b></p> <p>This is the crux.</p> <p>&nbsp;It seems Kiwis will be eligible if they've met the health and character requirements, lived in Australia for five years and, importantly, can prove they have earned equivalent or above the Temporary Skilled Migration Income Threshold (TSMIT) of A$53,900, or NZ$57,800. This is lower than Australia's median income.</p> <p>Australian authorities use this threshold as an indicator a job is skilled and affords a visa holder reasonable financial support.</p> <p><b>I'm out of the country back in New Zealand for a while. What about me?</b></p> <p>As long as you can demonstrate you're ordinarily resident and working in Australia you're eligible.</p> <p>You are not eligible if you have been out of Australia for more than one year in the first four years of the five-year period.</p> <p>And, you must not have been out of Australia for more than 90 days during the 12 months before applying.</p> <p><b>I don't earn enough but there's no way I can go back to New Zealand.</b></p> <p>The announcement has no impact on the SCV as it stands; Kiwis can still come and go under that visa as they always have. However under the SCV there is no pathway to citizenship.&nbsp;</p> <p>Apparently, &quot;limited exemptions&quot; to the A$53,900 threshold will be considered for &quot;particularly vulnerable&quot; New Zealanders.</p> <p>Details on this haven't been provided yet but the jobs could include, for example, primary carers, cases involving protected children, or people who cannot return to New Zealand for legal reasons.</p> <p><b>I'm on maternity leave and my income won't meet the threshold.</b></p> <p>The requirements for eligible applicants will take this into account and look at the record of income in Australia. It shouldn't disadvantage anyone on leave.</p> <p><b>Will it cost much?</b></p> <p>It does cost.</p> <p>The main application charge has been set at A$3600 per applicant, an extra A$1800 for partners and dependent children over 18 and A$900 for children under 18.</p> <p><b>So how do I become a citizen?</b></p> <p>If you meet the requirements for the special category pathway you can apply for citizenship after one year as a permanent resident.</p>","images":[{"id":13969203,"datetime_iso8601":"20160219T175814+1300","datetime_display":"17:58 19/02/2016","creditline":null,"caption":"Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced a new path for 70,000 Kiwis to apply for Aussie citizenship.","variants":[{"id":13969203,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455915162/203/13969203.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"618","height":"349"}]},{"id":13972730,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T095241+1300","datetime_display":"09:52 20/02/2016","creditline":"LAWRENCE SMITH/FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"fairfax-media","source_name":"Fairfax Media","caption":"In October, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his wife Lucy Turnbull were welcomed to Government House in Auckland by New Zealand Prime Minister John Key and his wife Bronagh.","variants":[{"id":13972730,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455915161/730/13972730.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"60"}]},{"id":13972731,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T095241+1300","datetime_display":"09:52 20/02/2016","creditline":"Konrad Mostert/123rf, Vitezslav Valka","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"Thousands of New Zealanders will be eligible for Australian citizenship.","variants":[{"id":13972731,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455915161/731/13972731.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"618","height":"349"}]},{"id":13972732,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T095241+1300","datetime_display":"09:52 20/02/2016","creditline":"Konrad Mostert/123rf, Vitezslav Valka","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"Thousands of New Zealanders will be eligible for Australian citizenship.","variants":[{"id":13972732,"layout":"Defcon Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455915161/732/13972732.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"418","height":"220"}]},{"id":13972733,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T095242+1300","datetime_display":"09:52 20/02/2016","creditline":"LAWRENCE SMITH/FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"fairfax-media","source_name":"Fairfax Media","caption":"In October, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his wife Lucy Turnbull were welcomed to Government House in Auckland by New Zealand Prime Minister John Key and his wife Bronagh.","variants":[{"id":13972733,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455915162/733/13972733.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"620","height":"349"}]},{"id":13972734,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T095242+1300","datetime_display":"09:52 20/02/2016","creditline":"LAWRENCE SMITH/FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"fairfax-media","source_name":"Fairfax Media","caption":"In October, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his wife Lucy Turnbull were welcomed to Government House in Auckland by New Zealand Prime Minister John Key and his wife Bronagh.","variants":[{"id":13972734,"layout":"Strap Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455915162/734/13972734.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"300","height":"200"}]},{"id":13972736,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T095242+1300","datetime_display":"09:52 20/02/2016","creditline":"PMO MEDIA","caption":"John Key and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced the breakthrough agreement on Kiwi expats following talks in Sydney on Friday.","variants":[{"id":13972736,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455915162/736/13972736.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"620","height":"348"}]},{"id":13972737,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T095242+1300","datetime_display":"09:52 20/02/2016","creditline":"PMO MEDIA","caption":"New Zealand Prime Minister John Key held talks with his Australian counterpart Malcolm Turnbull on Friday.","variants":[{"id":13972737,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1455915162/737/13972737.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"620","height":"349"}]}]},{"id":77038396,"path":"/sport/rugby/international/77038396/Quade-Coopers-little-black-book-holds-a-dark-secret-hes-a-Kiwi-after-all","url":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/_json/sport/rugby/international/77038396/Quade-Coopers-little-black-book-holds-a-dark-secret-hes-a-Kiwi-after-all","section":"Stuff","section-home":"International","section-top-level":"Sport","layout":"landscape-image","title":"Quade Cooper's little black book holds a dark secret -

Each year during the second half of February, if there&#39;s enough snowpack atop El Capitan, if the temperature&#39;s warm enough to produce enough snowmelt, if the western skies are clear, and if the setting sun hits the water and spray at just the right angle, the natural phenomenon of Firefall occurs. We arrived at the park late in the afternoon this past Saturday and found a parking spot along Southside Dr. halfway between Cathedral and Sentinel beaches just as the orange glow was beginning. The place was absolutely packed for this rare show, but I found a tiny opening and wedged myself between a photographer and a tourist. Squatting on wet, slippery ice with the photographer&#39;s backside a few inches from my grill, I managed to get this shot of Firefall at its peak glow.  ______________________________ Nikon D7100, Nikon 28-300. 125mm, f/14, 1/5 sec, ISO 100.

Webster said.</p> <p>Earlier this month Fonterra slashed its milk price forecast to $4.15/kg milk solids from a previous forecast of $4.60/kg. The break-even point for most farmers is about $5.40/kgMS.</p> <p>Waikato dairy farmers with staff will also be facing tough decisions over the next few months as they look ahead to another challenging season with little prospect of a lift in the milk price.</p> <p>Waikato Federated Farmers president Chris Lewis&nbsp;said farmers needed to consider whether to keep employing staff - from managers to sharemilkers and contract milkers - or bail out of the industry altogether.</p> <p>He believed many older farm owners, faced with the prospect of tighter environmental regulations and uncertainty over the milk price, might look to exit dairy farming.</p> <p>&quot;Farmers have come to the realisation of what this season and next season will look like and they are planning away,&quot; Lewis said.</p> <p>&quot;Some may have that kneejerk reaction now, most will be thinking in their mind how can we save this nest egg so we can have a comfortable retirement.&quot;</p> <p>So far there had been few forced exits from farm owners within Waikato, but Lewis would not be surprised if there was an influx of sales as the end of the season approaches.</p> <p>Northland man Greg Yuretich has been a dairy farmer for three decades and experienced the highs and lows of the industry.</p> <p>The tough times, however, were becoming more frequent and prompted him to devise a five to 10 year plan to exit dairy farming.</p> <p>He was looking to beef farming and bee hives as a way of diversifying his income.</p> <p>&quot;My family has farmed this land for 60 years and over time amalgamated three farms into one. But with this milk price you do ask yourself 'Why am I getting up in the morning?' My staff still get paid but I'm not getting anything.&quot;</p> <p>Webster, who leases farmland south-west of Kaitaia, said the next few months could decide her farming future and expected many smaller farms would be the first to fold.</p> <p>The advice to farmers was to cut their costs but that in itself wasn't a long-term solution to coping with a tumbling milk price, she said.</p> <p>&quot;During these hard time there's no doubt people will fall through the cracks,&quot; she said.</p> <p>&quot;I've been doing this for 14 years and for me it's probably too late to try and get out. But if I go under it's not like I'll lose the family farm that's been in the family for generations. Imagine how you'd feel if that was you.</p> <p>&quot;It's just a shame that so many hardworking and talented people might be lost to farming.&quot;</p> <p>The dairy downturn also means farmers are increasingly at the mercy of banks with a new Federated Farmers poll showing about one in 10 dairy farmers under pressure from banks over their mortgage.</p> <p>PGG Wrightson Real Estate general manager Peter Newbold said farmers were most likely holding off to see where the market was heading before making a decision to sell up.</p> <p>While there was no clear trend of farmers putting their farm on the market due to the dairy downturn, Newbold said there had been more farmers enquiring about selling.</p> <p>There were more conversations going on about potentially listing and he expected more farms to be put on the market in autumn.</p> <p>John Fegan, from Cambridge-based farm recruitment firm Fegan and Co, didn't expect huge numbers of farm owners or 50:50 sharemilkers to opt out of the industry because it would mean having to sell their herd at a time of low cow prices.&nbsp;</p> <p>Many farm employees were staying on with their current jobs into next season rather than risk moving to a new farm.</p> <p>&quot;Part of that rational is it's the devil you know rather than taking a risk on the market and not finding a better role,&quot; he said.</p> <p>He had yet to see many forced exits from farm owners or sharemilkers.</p> <p>&quot;It will probably be from now on that we'll start to hear about those.&quot;</p>","images":[{"id":13972516,"datetime_iso8601":"20160220T091828+1300","datetime_display":"09:18 20/02/2016","creditline":null,"source_code":"waikato-times","source_name":"Waikato
