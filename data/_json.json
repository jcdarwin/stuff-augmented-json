As a small town with a small ratepayer-base, Tekapo's infrastructure was struggling to cope, she said.</p> <p>One of town's tourist hotspots, the Church of the Good Shepherd, was having major issues as a result.</p> <p>&quot;We're having issues with human defecation and rubbish around the church,&quot; Sweney said.</p> <p>&quot;There are no toilets near the church.&quot;</p> <p>As a functioning parish, tourists wanting to take photos were also increasingly intruding on the privacy of parishioners, wedding parties, and funeral-goers, she said.</p> <p>The government used images of both the church and Tekapo to promote New Zealand internationally, and it needed to step up and help the town cope with the resulting tourist influx, she said.</p> <p>Sweney said revenue gathered from international visitors as part of their departure tax when leaving the country could be put towards infrastructure in popular tourist towns.</p> <p>&quot;It would be fantastic if the government recognised the pressure the marketing campaign is putting us under.&quot;</p> <p>Speaking after the forum, Sweney said the community board was considering making a recommendation to reduce the amount of parking near the church, and to move parking for buses to the other side of the Tekapo footbridge.</p> <p>Toilets could be installed near that parking space, she said.</p> <p>Rubbish bins near the church had also been trialled twice, but were removed because they were used as a dumping site.</p> <p>The increase in tourists heading to Tekapo had also impacted rubbish collection, with the town's bins having to be emptied up to three times per day, she said.</p> <p>Mackenzie District Council community facilities manager Garth Nixon said that was an issue over the Christmas period, but contractors were on a fixed contract so increased collection would not increase costs.</p> <p>Sweney told the forum the government also needed to amend the Freedom Camping Act.</p> <p>&quot;We'd love you to take the free out of freedom camping.&quot;</p> <p>She spoke at the BlueGreens Forum as part of a 'pitch a policy' time slot.</p> <p>The forum is the annual conference for the National Party's&nbsp;advisory group on environmental issues.&nbsp;</p> <p>In attendance were Environment Minister Nick Smith, Conservation Minister Maggie Barry, Associate Conservation Minister Nicky Wagner, Waitaki MP Jacqui Dean, and Rangitata MP Jo Goodhew.</p> <p>Many of the politicians who attended had approached Sweney afterwards, to say how much they enjoyed hearing from a local about the issues facing the town, she said.</p>","images":[{"id":13989453,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T170323+1300","datetime_display":"17:03 22/02/2016","creditline":"John Bisset","caption":"22022016 News John Bisset/FairfaxNZ.

But it's not just the prime minister and his advisers who get to travel on the plane.</p> <p>The guest list for the prime minister's latest trip across the Tasman includes some of New Zealand's most powerful and richest men and women - Xero founder Rod Drury, Mainfreight's Don Braid, and rich lister Sir William Gallagher among them, along with some of the country's top lawyers, lobbyists and CEO's.</p> <p>This is the power group that occupies the cabin directly behind &quot;first class&quot; where the prime minister and his senior staff fly. The Key family are also regular fliers. But this is the first time Max has grabbed nearly as much attention as his famous father.

Over the years it has been known by various names, including &quot;Spud One&quot;, in honour of former prime minister Jim Bolger.</p> <p>Cost is an obvious bonus of travelling with the prime minister but it is not the only attraction. </p> <p>Being part of the official party usually makes for a quick passage through customs and immigration, a blessing when heading overseas with the prime minister, whose schedule is usually a hectic race from one appointment to the next. </p> <p>Host governments usually provide a police motorcade to speed the prime minister's passage through rush hour traffic but media only get to tag along sometimes. The prime minister's office and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade make it their business to ensure the media get to where they need to be regardless - which is where ever the prime minister happens to be.</p> <p>There are other good reasons to love the Air Force VIP jet. There's the food, which tastes real, not like the usual plastic airline fare. The wine list is usually first class. </p> <p>And the air crew who bring round the food trolley and do the safety demonstrations are favourites with everyone and not just because of their big smiles and old fashioned manners. In an emergency you can just tell they've got your back.</p> <p>Then there are benefits of having a plane that's not hostage to the schedule, as journalists from the New Zealand Herald and Radio New Zealand found out last week. When their flight to Auckland from Wellington was cancelled and they looked like missing the departure time Key kept the plane on the tarmac for an extra 45 minutes to make sure they boarded. The journos got there with just minutes to spare before the Air Force's 5pm departure deadline ticked over.</p> <p>For the business men and women who score an invitation, meanwhile, there is an even more important draw card, and that's face time with the prime minister.</p> <p>Drury, who has been on a number of the Prime Minister's trips, says Key usually tries to get around every member of the delegation during the flight for some one on one time. In Sydney, the 27-strong delegation also shared a private breakfast with the Prime Minister. But during the flight, Key usually makes it down the back of the plane as well, hanging out in the aisles to talk to media, business people and air force crew.</p> <p>Drury says the fact the guest list for the plane trip is so exclusive is one of the big attractions and not just for that face time with Key.</p> <p>It's a small enough group to catch up with other leaders and compare notes with what's going on in their areas of business, or the economy.</p> <p>&quot;It's one of those things where you actually get to hang out with the CEO's so that's quite cool and you actually get a bit of quality time with John and some of the other ministers as well. And for us because we're such a big business in Australia as well so it's right to be there. And it's cool because New Zealand from a business-Government point of view actually has quite a good reputation, that it just really helps. A lot of the lessons we've learned we're able to apply to Australia and all the banking relationships and all those sorts of things we have go right through to the Australian parent company so it's a really worth while trip for us.</p><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"6\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:53.0092592593% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BCCimuXv9v-/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">Got caught sleeping on Air Force 1 today 😂!

But he's been on one hell of a journey to be able to say that.&nbsp;</p> <p>A bad decision at the age of 23 has followed him for more than 30 years.&nbsp;</p> <p>Mathew&nbsp;was sentenced to six months in prison for supplying cannabis to an undercover police officer - he'd had no prior run-ins with the law save for a few speeding tickets, he said.</p> <p>&quot;I had smoked a bit of weed, but I'd never sold it and I wasn't growing it,&quot; he said.</p> <p>&quot;But the judge said he would make sure I would never forget this.&quot;</p> <p>Within months of being incarcerated he was moved to another prison and missed the birth of his first child. He said he came out of prison &quot;very resentful and angry&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;No one would employ me because of my record. When I started to get no work, that made it even worse.&quot;</p> <p>He taught himself how to paint and became a self-employed painter and decorator, painting some of the biggest houses along the Waikato River.&nbsp;</p> <p>As his work increased he was able to employ others who found themselves in a similar situation after serving prison time, teaching them skills so they could go out on their own.&nbsp;</p> <p>In 2005 Mathew graduated from Unitec with a bachelor of social practice, with the aim of working with others who were struggling and marginalised in society. &nbsp;</p> <p>Armed with his degree, he applied for 36 jobs - and didn't receive a single call back.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;I would put on the form that there were specific circumstances relating to the incident which I'd love to speak about face to face,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;But they never rang back. No one.&quot;</p> <p>Mathew went back to tertiary study until one day in 2006 Te Whanau O&nbsp;Waipareira Trust&nbsp;offered him a job, where he has now been for the past 10 years working with high-needs Maori families, the homeless and those marginalised in their communities.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;A job is acceptance back into society,&quot; Mathew believes.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;If there isn't any acceptance, there was no point in me doing it.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;People should definitely be given the opportunity to prove they've made changes in their lives.</p> <p>&quot;We all grow up, don't tell me that you don't change.&quot;</p> <p><b>AT A GLANCE</b></p> <p>To be eligible for a &quot;clean slate&quot; in New Zealand, a person must have:</p> <p>* No convictions within the last seven years.</p> <p>* Never been sentenced to a custodial sentence including jail or corrective training.</p> <p>* Never been ordered by a court, after a criminal case, to be detained in a hospital because of a mental condition.</p> <p>* Never been convicted of a &quot;specified offence&quot; including sexual offending against children or the mentally impaired.</p> <p>* Paid in full any fine, reparation or costs ordered by a court in a criminal case.</p> <p>* Never been indefinitely disqualified from driving.</p> <p>Source: Ministry of Justice</p><iframe src=\"http://renderer.qmerce.com/interaction/56cab278e5be274a1fd0b1a1\"  width=\"100%\" height=\"437\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>","images":[{"id":13991031,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T202934+1300","datetime_display":"20:29 22/02/2016","creditline":"CHRIS MCKEEN/FAIRFAX NZ","caption":"Eric Knight wants the 'Clean Slate' law amended so he can work with disadvantaged youth.","variants":[{"id":13991031,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456126174/031/13991031.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"59"}]},{"id":13991032,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T202934+1300","datetime_display":"20:29 22/02/2016","creditline":"CHRIS MCKEEN/FAIRFAX NZ","caption":"Eric Knight wants the 'Clean Slate' law amended so he can work with disadvantaged youth.","variants":[{"id":13991032,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456126174/032/13991032.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"620","height":"349"}]},{"id":13991033,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T202934+1300","datetime_display":"20:29 22/02/2016","creditline":"CHRIS MCKEEN/FAIRFAX NZ","caption":"Eric Knight wants the 'Clean Slate' law amended so he can work with disadvantaged youth.","variants":[{"id":13991033,"layout":"Strap Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456126174/033/13991033.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"300","height":"200"}]},{"id":13991035,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T202934+1300","datetime_display":"20:29 22/02/2016","creditline":"CHRIS MCKEEN/FAIRFAX NZ","caption":"Eric Knight wants the 'Clean Slate' law amended so he can work with disadvantaged youth.","variants":[{"id":13991035,"layout":"Defcon Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456126174/035/13991035.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"418","height":"220"}]}],"datetime_unix":1456124750},{"id":77159881,"path":"/taranaki-daily-news/news/77159881/Cicadas-hard-to-listen-to-for-New-Plymouth-man-who-has-his-hearing-restored","url":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/_json/taranaki-daily-news/news/77159881/Cicadas-hard-to-listen-to-for-New-Plymouth-man-who-has-his-hearing-restored","section":"Stuff","section-home":"News","section-top-level":"Taranaki Daily News","layout":"landscape-image","title":"Cicadas hard to listen to for New Plymouth man who has his hearing restored","subhead":null,"alt_headline":"The gift of hearing ... pity about cicadas","datetime_iso8601":"20160222T212227+1300","datetime_display":"21:22 22/02/2016","byline":"LEIGHTON KEITH","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","intro":"A symphony of cicadas is just one of the sounds Dene McManus is having to adjust to hearing.","alt_intro":"\"It's like a referee blowing his whistle continuously ...

Johns Road in the leafy Auckland suburb of Meadowbank, the property was purchased by Warner Brothers late last year.<br /> <br /> &quot;The whole lot sold for $5.5 million dollars,&quot; the Kohimarama agent confirmed on Monday afternoon.</p> <p>&quot;I don't think I was allowed to say at the time, but I'm fairly sure it's all public knowledge now. The properties sold to Warner Brothers. There are five townhouses on the site, all very similar, they're not going to be demolishing them. The plan is to renovate them, as they've done in series before,&quot; he said.</p> <p>&quot;There's an old bungalow at the very front of lot number 97, which is going to be demolished, to build a carpark for the regulars and (tradies).&quot;</p> <p><b>READ MORE:<br /> *&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/74795114/The-Block-NZ-All-is-fair-in-love-and-Villa-Wars\" target=\"_blank\">The Block NZ: All is fair in love and Villa Wars<br /> </a>*&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/74804713/Buyer-of-The-Block-NZ-house-worked-on-the-show\" target=\"_blank\">Buyer of The Block NZ house worked on the show<br /> </a>*&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/74839477/The-Block-2016-bound-for-Meadowbank\" target=\"_blank\">The Block 2016 bound for Meadowbank?</a></b></p> <p>The agent said he believes the properties should &quot;sell very well&quot; depending on what the competing <i>Block NZ</i> teams decide to do with them.</p> <p>&quot;Well they're right on the cusp of Remuera, so they should sell well,&quot; he said.</p> <p>The sizeable lot in its entirety, which sold for a whopping $5.5 million dollars, can house up to six or even seven properties.</p> <p>According to official council documents, which lists the MediaWorks affiliated production company Eyeworks TV as &quot;proprietor&quot; for lot number 95-97 St Johns Road, Meadowbank, one would be safe to assume the site is all but confirmed.</p> <p>In December of last year, residents of St Johns Road received a mysterious letter bearing a Warner Brothers letterhead, dated December 4 2015, stating:<br /> <br /> &quot;We would like to advise you of up and coming building and filming in your area associated with the television show&nbsp;<i>The Block NZ</i>.<br /> <br /> &quot;We will be holding a community meeting to give you specific information relating to the project and to answer any questions you may have. We will be joined by representatives from MediaWorks (TV3) and the Auckland Council.&quot;</p> <p>Meadowbank, a mere stone's throw from the leafy Auckland suburb of Remuera and the surrounding suburbs of St Johns, St Heliers and Kohimarama, is renowned for its older residents and quieter community.</p> <p>The site in question neighbours the quiet surrounds of the Purewa Cemetery and Crematorium, which occupies number 100 St Johns Road. The tranquil garden site is a popular and sought after funeral location.</p> <p>The site, which will be housed only metres up the road from the cemetery, faces a multitude of practical problems.</p> <p>The busy traffic flow and often congested intersection will no doubt make it difficult for residents driving out of the surrounding side streets such as Blackett Crescent, with the intersection already dangerously busy and blocked up during peak traffic times.</p> <p>The agent behind the sale however, argued not too much should change for concerned residents.</p> <p>&quot;It shouldn't be too bad, no. The tradies and the 4WD and trucks might be a bit of a nuisance, but I can't imagine it'll make too much difference (to the neighbourhood)&quot;.</p> <p>During previous seasons of the popular reality show, local residents in Takapuna complained about the traffic and noise at all hours of the night, during the show's hectic filming schedule.</p> <p>&quot;In 2013 my daughter had a friend who lived in Takapuna, near where they were building that season's houses,&quot; said one concerned Meadowbank local.<br /> <br /> &quot;She said it was absolute chaos. It was quite a big section with just one house on it, I imagine it will be quite a tight squeeze,&quot; she said.</p> <p>&quot;We have trouble getting out of our road and turning onto St Johns as it is - I can't imagine what it would be like with a whole lot of workers around.&quot;</p> <p>Last year speculation was rife that the prospective site was located at number 71 St Johns Road, due to the recent property demolitions on the site.</p> <p>St John's Road is surrounded by three schools - Meadowbank Primary, Remuera Intermediate and Selwyn College, making for a busy spot as it is.</p> <p>While last year's residents were urged &quot;not to talk to the media&quot; and advised that 71 St Johns Road wasn't the site in question, it would be safe to say the newly-acquired lot is right on the money.</p> <p>MediaWorks and TV3 had &quot;no comment&quot; when approached on Monday evening.</p>","images":[{"id":13990309,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T183023+1300","datetime_display":"18:30

said Oxfam Pacific Regional Director Raijeli Nicole.</p> <p>&quot;Given the intensity of the storm and the images we have seen so far, there are strong concerns that the death toll won't stop climbing today and that hundreds of people will have seen their homes and livelihoods completely destroyed.&quot;</p> <p>Aerial footage of villages taken by the Royal New Zealand Air Force and posted on the Fijian government's official website of the outlying islands showed whole villages flattened and flooded.</p> <p>A curfew in place for more than 36 hours was lifted early on Monday, allowing the Fijian military to ramp up efforts to reach the more remote parts of the archipelago of about 300 islands.</p> <p>Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama has declared a 30-day state of emergency, with schools ordered to shut.</p> <p>&quot;When we are able, we will provide timelines for the return of water and power,&quot; he said, adding that electricity supply to some areas had been deliberately cut to avert further damage.</p> <p>The archipelago of about 300 islands was hit late on Saturday by tropical cyclone Winston, which packed winds of 230km/h that gusted up to 325kmh.</p> <p>Businessman Jay Dayal, who lives near Rakiraki, on the north coast of Fiji's main island where the cyclone hit land, said the storm damage was extensive.</p> <p>&quot;I wouldn't be surprised if people are now starting to go without food,&quot; he said. &quot;It looks like a different country; it doesn't look like Fiji.&quot;</p> <p>Humanitarian agencies warned Fiji might be facing a health crisis, mainly due to the lack of electricity. Low-lying river areas where hundreds of people live in tin sheds were also particularly vulnerable, aid workers said.</p> <p>&quot;We need electricity to ensure pumps are working and for sterilisation,&quot; Raijeli Nicole, an official of aid agency Oxfam, said.</p> <p>An elderly man died on Koro Island when a roof fell on him, authorities said.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a nearby village, 50 homes were reported to have been destroyed.</p> <p>Food and water supplies are a growing concern.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Consumer Council of Fiji has urged traders not to sell food and other perishable items that have gone bad due to the effects of the cyclone.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Council's chief executive Premila Kumar said supermarkets and other food stores should destroy such items.</p> <p>Survivors spoke of the horror of the cyclone, while aid workers scrambled to help victims.</p> <p>&quot;The noise was deafening. At one point, I turned to my partner and questioned whether we would actually survive,&quot; Sarah Bingham, an Australian on holiday on Tokoriki Island, said.</p> <p>&quot;Some villages have reported that all homes have been destroyed,&quot; Jone Tuiipelehaki, of the United Nations Development Program, tweeted late on Saturday.</p> <p>People flocked to 758 evacuation centres on Saturday, while tourists hunkered down in hotel ballrooms and conference rooms in coastal areas.</p> <p>&quot;The images that we're starting to see roll in are terrifying,&quot; Alice Clements, a UNICEF official based in Suva said by telephone, describing images of a car on a building roof and a small plane nose down in debris.</p> <p>Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who offered to send a P-3 Orion aircraft to help in the relief effort, said about 1200 Australians were registered as being in Fiji, although there could be many more.</p> <p>The Australian and New Zealand governments authorised the release of emergency aid supplies held in the Fijian capital of Suva.</p> <p>&quot;These stores will ensure communities have access to safe drinking water and basic hygiene for those who have lost their houses or are displaced,&quot; Bishop said.</p> <p>She added that the high level of preparation by the Fijian government had helped keep the death toll low.</p> <p>Virgin Australia said it would resume flights on Monday, while Jetstar said it was still assessing the situation.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Fijian government has reopened its main airport at Nadi.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Aerial shots by NZ Defense force.

anything differently. Maybe with a tad more air speed that exaggerates reverse swing and our guys seem to be able to go a little bit both ways,&quot; batsman Adam Voges said.</p> <p>&quot;We look after the ball, we again got one of the sides a little bit scuffed and looked after the other side and away we went. It's one thing to reverse it, it's another thing to have the skills to do it,&quot; he added.</p> <p>The tourists were unfazed by the umpires' warning. &quot;There's a line. I'm sure most fielding teams will get as close to the line as they can without overstepping it.&quot;</p> <p>New Zealand gloveman BJ Watling said they had no issues with Australia pushing the boundaries in the field.</p> <p>&quot;That's just part of the game. We do talk about that. They were successful at it and we didn't quite get it to go.&quot;</p> <p>So it was the short-pitched barrage instead that worked for Wagner.</p> <p>The New Zealand left-armer, a few weeks short of his 30th birthday, snared career-best figures in his first test against Australia.</p> <p>His first seven overs went for 36 as he went too full then too short. The next 25.1 saw him take 6-70, all his wickets to bouncers aimed at the throat region as the Australian batsmen kept taking him on and finding the fielders.</p> <p>&quot;It was a pretty special bowling performance. It was about 25 overs of good fast short-pitched bowling and he got us right back into a position where we can hopefully try and win the game,&quot; said a hopeful Watling, his team 121-4 and still trailing by 14.</p> <p>&quot;He almost gets faster the deeper he goes into his spells. He's done it for us on many occasions and today he got his rewards. It was just a fantastic effort; for a fast bowler to do that for 25 overs is pretty special.&quot;</p> <p>Not required for the previous four trans-Tasman tests this summer, Wagner edged out Mark Craig for the series finale in Christchurch.</p> <p>They sure needed him, even if he was the fifth bowler summoned in the 33rd over, as key strikers Tim Southee and Matt Henry went wicketless from 57 combined overs with the ball doing very little swing or seam.</p> <p>Wagner's made a habit of excelling on docile pitches. His only five-wicket bag from 18 previous tests was 5-64 against Bangladesh in Dhaka in 2013.</p> <p>This time the short ball worked for him.

It's 1-0 in the series and we've got to go out there and try to win this test match,&quot; said gloveman BJ Watling who's next in,</p> <p>A healthy Christchurch crowd who'd earlier stood silent for the five-year anniversary of the devastating earthquake, dared to dream one final time in a cricketing sense. In reality, a repeat of Saturday's stunning world record 54-ball hundred was a slim chance but New Zealand needed something big from McCullum as they teetered at 72-3.</p> <p>In the end the farewell show was 36 minutes long - 25 off 27 balls - and was done by 5.20pm. McCullum reined himself in, defended stoutly then survived a cheeky caught and bowled shout from Pattinson which clearly hit the pitch. He freed his arms and swivel pulled Hazlewood over the rope.</p> <p>The warmed-up crowd were with McCullum and at Pattinson, but his final scoring shot in test cricket was his 107th six. Next ball a cross bat slash was brilliantly plucked by David Warner at short mid-wicket, who moved even faster to shake McCullum's hand as he wandered off one last time, the crowd on their feet and the skipper flourishing his bat. Show over.</p> <p>After a lion-hearted bowling performance from Neil Wagner, for a career-best 6-106, the Black Caps' batting again folded under Australian pressure.&nbsp;It was quality quick bowling, too, as the ball began reversing and Pattinson and Hazlewood bent their backs. Both tall men, they made life distinctly uncomfortable in a way the home bowlers clearly couldn't, bar Wagner. Pattinson had 3-29 after the horror of his no-ball on Saturday that gave McCullum a let-off on 39.</p> <p>&quot;The coach [Darren Lehmann] didn't miss him after play on day one. And that's probably putting it nicely. Look, he got a rocket and he's come out and responded the way he did. So he probably didn't disagree with anything the coach said after play that night but full credit to Patto the way he's bounced back and he was excellent today,&quot; team-mate Adam Voges said.</p> <p>This deficit was nowhere near that of Wellington - where the Black Caps suffered an innings defeat - but it required the patience and application that was lacking there on a similarly friendly surface containing few terrors.</p> <p>It's just not happening for Martin Guptill against Australia and he'll be relieved there's four more years till the next trans-Tasman test. The opener, feet anchored, nicked off to an impeccable line from Pattinson for a 12-ball duck, ending his test summer against Australia with 163 runs at an average of 16.3.</p> <p>Neither opener has gone big against Australia. Tom Latham (39) continued his pattern of a solid, hard-working foundation followed by a loose shot; after toiling 105 minutes and surviving some early swishes he touched one down the leg side.</p> <p>Henry Nicholls got sucked in by a full, wider one and chased it, edging on two and the slide was on, still 63 behind. Ross Taylor batted in the nets out the back, still recovering from his side strain, but his team-mates needed him badly in the centre.</p> <p>Remarkably it was Wagner's first test against Australia, having become a go-to for the Black Caps on flat, unresponsive pitches. In 18 previous tests his only five-wicket bag was in Dhaka, 5-64 in October 2013.</p> <p>McCullum needed someone to stand up or they were eyeing up 600. They persisted with the leg side trick and Wagner kept charging in throughout his 32.1 overs and demanding some life from the surface.</p> <p>Tim Southee and Matt Henry both went wicketless in 57 combined overs. Southee looked well below his best and was used sparingly later in the innings, while Henry bowled with the most heat and was unlucky on day two.</p>","images":[{"id":13991050,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T203726+1300","datetime_display":"20:37 22/02/2016","creditline":null,"caption":"*","variants":[{"id":13991050,"layout":"Small

This, not the scintillating 145 from 79 on a sunny Saturday afternoon, was the actual end point: game over with two days to play.</p> <p>McCullum defended the first delivery, and the next six on the bounce - he took a two off the eighth when Pattinson returned, a couple culminating in 34-year-old sprawling for the popping crease to beat throw from fine leg.</p> <p>Normal service then resumed, a ramp shot on tippy toes overs the slip cordon, then a glide along the carpet in the same area to the rope.</p> <p>He then cut Josh Hazlewood to the point at fence to build a strike rate that has been a hallmark of his 101-test career.</p> <p>Pattinson, the most aggressive, and therefore least popular Australian bowler, cheekily thought he had McCullum on 19 with a return catch only for replays to indicate a thick inside edge thudded into the pitch before ballooning down the pitch.</p> <p>Ridiculed for his appeal, Pattinson then lost more face with an optimistic LBW appeal to a delivery sailing down leg - a plea that prompted the crowd to appeal on the Victorian's behalf for the remainder of that over.</p> <p>Pattinson, to his credit, appeared to apologise to a grinning McCullum, who then set about attempting to Josh Hazlewood's figures for posterity.</p> <p>After regaining the strike he missed a four ball down leg and then got a thick edge to a beauty that nipped off the seam.</p> <p>Hazlewood's next ball was dug in short and swung deep over the square - his 107th six to move him seven clear of Adam Gilchrist.</p> <p>At that point Adam Voges was concerned another swashbuckling exhibition of power hitting was gathering momentum.</p> <p>&quot;There's always the fear. Especially when he played that pull shot over square leg for six, he was starting to see them better.&quot;</p> <p>Naturally, and in this instance fatally, McCullum was not content with just six an over so he skipped down the pitch and heaved towards mid-wicket.</p> <p>It was a decent connect though not meaty enough to prevent a diving David Warner, who, after gleefully celebrating, made a beeline to see McCullum politely on his way. Teammates followed suit. There was no gloating, no animosity.</p> <p>In that regard it was an un-Australian end to an archetypal innings from McCullum: 25 runs, 27 balls. Three boundaries, a six, 36 minutes of light amid the gloom.</p> <p><b>Brendon McCullum's international statistics:</b></p> <p>Tests: 101</p> <p>Innings: 176</p> <p>Not Out: 9</p> <p>Runs: 6408</p> <p>Average: 38.37</p> <p>Highest score: 302 v India, Basin Reserve, Feb 2014</p> <p>100s: 12</p> <p>50s: 31</p> <p>Boundaries: 776</p> <p>Sixes: 107 -

Waikato River, in the early hours of March 6, 2015.&nbsp;</p> <p>An earlier report said he was found with head injuries.</p> <p>At a coroner's inquest in Hamilton on Monday,&nbsp;Hamilton&nbsp;Detective Constable Marcus Hunter said O'Connor had been drinking with two friends.</p> <p><b>READ MORE:&nbsp;<a

hostel O'Connor was staying at, on the northern end of Anglesea St. O'Connor had been in Hamilton on a business trip.</p> <p>The three friends started drinking whiskey at 8pm and then they headed to town at 10pm to find a bar and watch sports.</p> <p>&quot;Sean is described at being a little drunk at this stage, but handling himself OK,&quot; Hunter said.</p> <p>&quot;The group eventually got to a bar where more beer was consumed. Sean was showing signs of intoxication and told to leave by the bouncer.&quot;</p> <p>At the second bar on Hood St, a barman noticed O'Connor was intoxicated and refused to serve him more alcohol. He let O'Connor stay and gave him water.</p> <p>But after a misunderstanding between the friends, O'Connor was asked to leave the bar.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;Sean is now alone and is walking through the city area,&quot; Hunter said.</p> <p>&quot;Eventually he walked on to Anglesea St, past the Countdown supermarket and entered the residential property at the end of the cul-de-sac.&quot;</p> <p>O'Connor walked onto a property and fell down a steep embankment on the edge of the section.&nbsp;Hunter said there was a retainer wall but the section was not well-lit.</p> <p>Passersby found him on Hillsborough Tce just after 12am.</p> <p>A blood test taken from O'Connor showed a reading of 242mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. The driving limit for those over 20 is&nbsp;50mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood.&nbsp;</p> <p>His mother, Marie O'Connor, said at the inquest that she was concerned about the signage in the area.</p> <p>She asked whether a sign could be placed in the area to warn people of the embankment and make the area safer.</p> <p>&quot;We've seemed to piece together what has happened on Sean's decision to take that wrong turn,&quot; she said.</p> <p>&quot;I don't think Sean knew he was going in the wrong direction ... he knew his hotel was at the very end of Anglesea St.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;There are no visible signs to say it's a no exit street ... he's not realised that there's a drop there and he's panicked.&quot;</p> <p>O'Connor said her son's trip to New Zealand was supposed to be his last before he settled in Australia.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;Sean was a lovely person, a lovely son.

Sorry - they do care, they just care much more about Mark Zuckerberg, who showed up as the only surprise in Samsung's extremely leaky launch, or Apple, who are busy taking on the FBI, or LG, who are making some drastically <i>weird</i> phones.</p> <p>It isn't just a media problem. Samsung's sales were heavily down a few years ago too. There's still a diehard core of avid fans, as well as plenty of casual users along for the shiny ride, but more and more people are taking a different path.</p> <p><b>READ MORE:&nbsp;<br /> <a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/gadgets/77120139/samsung-unveils-new-galaxy-s7\" target=\"_blank\">* Samsung unveils new Galaxy S7<br /> </a><a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/gadgets/77130995/first-impressions-samsung-s7-and-s7-edge\" target=\"_blank\">* First impressions: Samsung S7 and S7 Edge</a></b></p> <p>What path? On the $1000+ end, where these two new phones sit, there's Apple, whose entry into the&nbsp;'giant phone' market has&nbsp;devastated Samsung's hold over the highly profitable segment.</p> <p>In the mid range of $400-$800 phones a whole plethora of options exist: the popular Motorola G, the evergreen Nexus range, even older iPhones.</p> <p>Down at the bottom are nimble upstarts like China's Xiaomi, who have come out of nowhere to be one of the most popular brands on the planet.&nbsp;</p> <p>I was at the New Zealand launch of the two new phones this morning.</p> <p>The event was pleasant and well-executed - although I managed to accidentally catch a sneak peek at the devices when I took the wrong door after a trip to the bathroom.&nbsp;</p> <p>Unlike most vertically integrated tech giants, Samsung puts a lot of effort into localisation, with a whole deck of NZ-specific executives ready for all my questions.&nbsp;</p> <p>I came away, as I often do when I really look at a Samsung phone, impressed but not sold - the camera seems brighter and sharper than my iPhones, but the photos look slightly&nbsp;over-sharpened, and the software just gets in the way.</p> <p>Both phones can do numerous things that the iPhone 6S in my pocket can't, but the features are mostly not reliable or useful enough to really make me desire them.</p> <p>These are much better phones than the S4 or S5, but they will get nowhere near the hype. I don't think I'm exactly a unique consumer either - I just want a phone with a good camera, a decent screen, and a frictionless software experience.&nbsp;</p> <p>It's hard to see where Samsung quite fit into the market in 2016.</p> <p>The Galaxy used to be the anti-iPhone on the high end- it was bigger, it got more tricks and new features, and it often cost less.</p> <p>Now the best Galaxies cost around the same as an iPhone, are around the same size, and don't offer many bells or whistles that you can't get on a cheaper LG phone.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the middle range Samsung's competitors are increasingly not bothering to develop their own smartphone software, instead relying on the stock standard clean Android experience that users seem to prefer anyway.</p> <p>But Samsung have put too much effort into their often-annoying Android skin to abandon it fully now.</p> <p>These days the company feels like a middle child, desperate for the attention they once garnered.</p> <p>But I wouldn't write them off. As a chaebol, Samsung have an endless array of revenue streams, research labs, and logistical expertise to build off.</p> <p>If you can manage to convince us that we need six-inch giant smartphones, you can probably convince us to buy anything.</p>","images":[{"id":13990704,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T192944+1300","datetime_display":"19:29 22/02/2016","creditline":null,"source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"A hands on look at some of the S7 and S7 Edge's new features.","variants":[{"id":13990704,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456122664/704/13990704.png","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"59"}]},{"id":13990723,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T193104+1300","datetime_display":"19:31 22/02/2016","creditline":"Reuters","caption":"The new Samsung S7 edge and S7 smartphones are displayed after their unveiling ceremony at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain.","variants":[{"id":13990723,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456122664/723/13990723.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"620","height":"349"}]},{"id":13990724,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T193105+1300","datetime_display":"19:31 22/02/2016","creditline":"stuff","caption":"The Samsung S7 Edge is dipped underwater.","variants":[{"id":13990724,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456122665/724/13990724.png","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"60"}]},{"id":13990725,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T193105+1300","datetime_display":"19:31 22/02/2016","creditline":"stuff","caption":"The Samsung S7 Edge is dipped underwater.","variants":[{"id":13990725,"layout":"Strap Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456122665/725/13990725.png","media_type":"Photo","width":"300","height":"200"}]},{"id":13990727,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T193105+1300","datetime_display":"19:31 22/02/2016","creditline":"stuff","caption":"The Samsung S7 Edge is dipped underwater.","variants":[{"id":13990727,"layout":"Defcon Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456122665/727/13990727.png","media_type":"Photo","width":"418","height":"220"}]},{"id":13990728,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T193105+1300","datetime_display":"19:31 22/02/2016","creditline":"stuff","caption":"The Samsung S7 Edge is dipped underwater.","variants":[{"id":13990728,"layout":"ipad section splash 956:956","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456122665/728/13990728.png","media_type":"Photo","width":"956","height":"956"}]}],"videos":[{"id":13987654,"layout":"Standard Video","datetime_iso8601":"20160222T142305+1300","datetime_display":"14:23 22/02/2016","creditline":"Henry Cooke/Fairfax NZ","caption":"Henry Cooke gives a hands-on look at some of the S7 and S7 Edge's new features at a Samsung event in Auckland.","src":"https://assets.stuff.co.nz/video/production/1456103628259-S7%20launch.mp4","video_poster":{"id":13987663,"layout":"Video Image","src":"http://file2.stuff.co.nz/1456122666/663/13987663.png","width":"620","height":"349"}}],"datetime_unix":1456122616},{"id":77124304,"path":"/manawatu-standard/news/77124304/Fiordland-crested-penguin-ends-up-in-Foxton","url":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/_json/manawatu-standard/news/77124304/Fiordland-crested-penguin-ends-up-in-Foxton","section":"Stuff","section-home":"News","section-top-level":"Manawatu Standard","layout":"landscape-video","title":"Fiordland crested penguin ends up in Foxton","subhead":null,"alt_headline":"Penguin found 1000km from home","datetime_iso8601":"20160222T192851+1300","datetime_display":"19:28 22/02/2016","byline":"NICHOLAS MCBRIDE","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","category_id":"Stuff","stream_id":"stuff/manawatu-standard/news/77124304","intro":"A Fiordland crested penguin found itself a long way from home when he  discovered about 1000km away on Foxton Beach.","alt_intro":"Endangered penguin swims more than 1000km to end up on Foxton Beach.","body":"<p>A Fiordland crested penguin found itself a long way from home when he &nbsp;discovered about 1000km away on Foxton Beach.</p> <p>The endangered&nbsp;Fiordland crested penguin, or tawaki, typically breeds along coastlines south of Bruce Bay in South Westland, to Fiordland and the islands of Foveaux Strait and Stewart Island.</p> <p>However one young male went a step further, swimming roughly more than 1000km from Fiordland to show up on Foxton Beach on Sunday.</p> <p>The bird was found by Department of Conservation staff and brought to&nbsp;Wildbase Hospital in Palmerston North after an attempt to send it back home was unsuccessful.</p> <p>DOC Manawatu biodiversity senior ranger Clint Purches said they got a phone call from a member of the public after the penguin swam ashore with her dog.</p> <p>&quot;I popped it back in the water and it went along the beach and came straight back into the next lot of people,&quot;

A single dog has the potential to wipe out an entire colony.

school when a child sex offender taught there, want an investigation into his time at the school.</p> <p>Robert Selwyn Burrett, 64,&nbsp;pleaded guilty at the Christchurch High Court on Friday, to sexual abuse against girls aged five to 12.</p> <p>It related to 12 Christchurch primary school girls who were victims.&nbsp;Three of them&nbsp;had physical and mental disabilities.&nbsp;</p> <p>Before moving to Christchurch in 2006, Burrett lived with his wife in the King Country and worked at a Te Kuiti primary school.</p> <p>A father of two daughters who attended the King Country school when Burrett was teaching there over a decade ago, said he was not aware of the offending until details were recently posted on a Facebook page.</p> <p>&quot;My thoughts immediately went to my girls,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;I [telephoned] one of my daughter's up at 11pm. I needed to check whether he had done anything to them. They said he hadn't, but my mind cannot rest. We have a connection to nearly everyone here. Given what he's done, there needs to be an investigation into his time here.&quot;</p> <p>His daughters are now aged in their 20s.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;If there are more victims out there, then there should be things put in place to make sure they get the justice they deserve. Just thinking about what he did makes me sick.&quot;</p> <p>Another mum of a former student, said she also wants an investigation<span>.</span></p> <p>&quot;We know everyone in the town so if any of them were hurt during his time, it would effect the entire town. I just want someone to really look at his time here.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p>A former student who was in Burrett's class for two years described him as a &quot;good teacher&quot; but when he would get angry it was best to stay out of his way.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;He would throw black board dusters and chalk at us kids when he was mad.

Most were left with cuts and bruises, but some were taken from the scene on stretchers with braces around their necks.</p> <p>The bus driver was seen slumped on the ground near the bus, with a bloodied face and legs, before he was taken from the scene on a stretcher.&nbsp;</p> <p>Eleven passengers had been taken to hospital for observation, as well as the bus driver.</p> <p>An attendee at the Asia-Pacific Incentives and Meetings conference said that the passengers on the bus had been travelling around Melbourne for a morning session to visit local landmarks and venues, and were due to return to the Melbourne Convention Centre at Southbank for lunch.</p> <p>Instead, about 600 shocked delegates were told the news that their colleagues had been involved in the crash, and were lucky to be alive.</p> <p>Described as the largest international tourism and events conference in Australia, the AIME started on Monday morning, and would run until Wednesday.</p> <p>&quot;There was a lot of people at the luncheon who just started looking at their tablets and their phone and couldn't believe it had happened,&quot; a conference delegate said.</p> <p>&quot;Everyone was like 'it could have been us'.</p> <p>&quot;It's really unfortunate it's happened at a conference where people are looking at investing in Australia for tourism and major events.&quot;</p> <p>Metropolitan Fire Brigade commander Andrew O'Connell said the ordeal would have been &quot;absolutely terrifying&quot; for the people on board.</p> <p>&quot;Luckily ... they all ducked their heads and closed their eyes to keep themselves out of trouble. And I think that's actually helped them remarkably keep uninjured,&quot; he said.</p> <p>The roof of the bus had to be peeled back and several front seats removed before firefighters could reach the trapped passengers.</p> <p>O'Connell praised the firefighters for managing to free the passengers from such a small area within an hour.</p> <p>He said the height of the rail bridge would have been just above the passengers' head height.</p> <p>&quot;When I responded to this particular call it sounded very nasty and I am very grateful ... that when we arrived we found no one with significant injuries,&quot; O'Connell said.</p> <p>&quot;[The bus] seems to have been driven in at considerable speed.&quot;</p> <p>By midday, a tow truck was preparing to remove the bus from the scene, while authorities had begun picking up debris from the road.&nbsp;</p> <p>About the same time, the Gold Bus Ballarat logos on the side of the bus were covered with grey tape. It is not known who covered the logo, or for what reason.</p> <p>Montague Street in South Melbourne is closed in both directions between Normanby Road and City Road.</p> <p>The Victoria state roading authority, VicRoads, has advised motorists in the area to use Ingles Street.</p> <p>The road is expected to remain closed until at least 5.30pm (7.30pm NZT), while authorities inspect the bridge's safety barrier, a VicRoads spokesman said.</p> <p>The spokesman said a crane was needed to help with the repairs.</p> <p>Witnesses said it appeared the bus was almost a metre higher than the bridge's minimal clearance, and that it struck the bridge without slowing.</p> <p>&quot;It was scary,&quot; car salesman Ramsey Melhem, who works at nearby South Melbourne Toyota, said.</p> <p>&quot;Something is always happening down there with the trucks - things falling off - but this takes it to a new level.</p> <p>&quot;I just don't understand how he [the driver] could have hit it. It was pretty obvious that he wasn't going to get through.&quot;</p> <p>A local storage business operator, who asked to be known only as Tim, said the crash sounded like a regular car crash.</p> <p>&quot;Only the sound went on for longer,&quot; he said.</p> <p>He said the bridge was a constant problem for trucks and other tall vehicles.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;Usually it is air conditioning units coming off trucks - it happens every other week,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Tim said there were insufficient warnings for truck and bus drivers about the upcoming bridge and suggested flashing lights were needed for approaching drivers.</p> <p>Inspector Jo Dolan said police had not yet had a chance to interview the bus driver. She said she expected VicRoads would review safety measures at the bridge.</p> <p>Route 109 trams, which run over the bridge, were suspended for 10 minutes.</p> <p>&quot;It is safe for our trams to be running along there now,&quot; a Yarra Trams spokeswoman said about 11.30am.</p> <p>The spokeswoman said a Yarra Trams operations officer was at the scene, working with emergency services.</p> <p>The bus crash is the latest in a series involving rail bridges, the worst of which saw a truck roll over at the intersection of Flinders and Spencer streets bringing the city to a halt on February 1.</p> <p>Earlier this month, a truck struck a rail bridge at Newmarket.</p> <p>In 2006, a bus carrying Commonwealth Games volunteers crashed into the same light rail bridge over Montague Street. No one was seriously injured in that crash.</p> <p>Matthew Baird, director of Gold Bus Ballarat, said that the company was working closely with emergency services.</p> <p>He said further details of the crash would be provided as soon as the facts were clarified.</p> <p>&quot;Our first priority is the welfare of the passengers and our driver, and assisting emergency services where we can,&quot; he said.</p> <p>The Gold Bus Ballarat fleet are part of 300 buses and coaches owned and operated by the Donric​ Group, which also runs the Sunbury Bus Service, Coach Tours of Australia, Bacchus Marsh Coaches, Organ's Coaches Kyneton, and Trans North Bus and Coach.</p>","images":[{"id":13987509,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T140544+1300","datetime_display":"14:05

They're just constantly chasing their tail.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p>The health board has suffered payroll problems since as far back as 2012, when it reported 5757 total underpayment incidents.</p> <p>Some staff have reported being overpaid, but most complaints relate to underpayment.</p> <p>New Zealand Nurses Organisation organiser Georgia Choveaux said: &quot;Because pay rates differ significantly between shifts and days, the nursing team often find it hard to even know whether there is a problem with their pay or not.&quot;</p> <p>Ian Powell, executive director of the Association of Salaried Medical Specialists, said: &quot;Generally it's unsatisfactory, and some would say diabolical.&quot;</p> <p>There had been recent improvements, but &quot;it's still very very slow and it really is unreliable in terms of people knowing whether they've been paid the right amount or not.&quot;</p> <p>Deborah Powell said constantly checking for payroll mistakes was undermining staff morale and there was a &quot;snowball effect&quot; with routine pay issues absorbing the time of payroll staff, which often left one-off problems neglected.</p> <p>&quot;It's exhausting. To have to check your pay is another thing on top of what is a mentally and physically demanding job.</p> <p>&quot;Our members describe just being deflated and giving up. They work hard and expect pay should not be one of the hassles in their lives.&quot;</p> <p>She said Apex intervened in December on behalf of more than 50 CCDHB radiographers on several issues while other staff waited for shift and on-call leave to be processed.</p> <p>CCDHB's payroll was under-resourced and unnecessarily complex, but the payroll errors were probably not a deliberate or malicious strategy, she said. Nevertheless, there were too many errors and the response time in sorting out payroll mistakes was too slow.</p> <p>One person familiar with the payroll system said it had been tweaked several times, comparing it with a house that had structural problems on which cosmetic work was done, but underlying issues never fixed.</p> <p>CCDHB chief financial officer Tony Hickmott said the health board took issues affecting people's pay seriously. Every fortnight it processed pay for about 5100 workers, across 20 multi-employer collective agreements.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;A small percentage of people raise issues with us following pay runs. At the start of each year, issues can also occur when the DHB has large intakes of new staff including junior doctors and nursing graduates.&quot;</p> <p>Pay issues generally arose around rostered workers, or new staff who worked different shifts and had some extra payment arrangements for overtime and shift allowances, he said.</p> <p>&quot;When issues are raised we prioritise them, and where necessary make a special payment to affected people, so that they do not have to wait until the next pay-cycle.</p> <p>&quot;We appreciate that any issue with a person's pay is frustrating, and we are constantly looking for ways to improve the&nbsp;many business processes that surround pay.&quot;</p> <p>In 2012, timesheets submitted late were blamed for the highest number of underpayments, the DHB said in an Official Information Act response at the time.</p>","images":[{"id":13990366,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T184847+1300","datetime_display":"18:48 22/02/2016","creditline":"LOUIE

have led to unbearable heartache for Australian man Wishhasad Somawansa.</p> <p>Somawansa, 21, had not seen Sigaragh Baea in more than a decade until they ran into each other late last year.</p> <p>Now, his mother is dead and his primary school best friend has been charged with her murder.</p> <p>Baea was invited to the Somawansas' Hoppers Crossing, Melbourne, home for dinner in January, where Prasad Somawansa, 48, lavished him with hospitality.</p> <p>The accused killer allegedly turned up unexpectedly at the family's Barber Drive home last Thursday night, not long before Somawansa was called out to a voluntary job with the State Emergency Service.</p> <p>Somawansa allegedly dropped Baea at Werribee Plaza, Seven News reported on Sunday.</p> <p>Less than two hours later, Somawansa's mother was dead.</p> <p>Her truck driver husband Priyantha was in Brisbane and was on the phone to his wife when he heard &quot;distressing noises&quot;.</p> <p>Concerned, he tried to phone his son, but Wishhasad's mobile phone battery was reportedly dead.</p> <p>His father then called a colleague to check on his wife.</p> <p>That person arrived to find the front door of the family's two-storey home wide open, and Prasad&nbsp;Somawansa dead inside.</p> <p>Police said last week the disturbing crime, which left her with severe upper body injuries, may have been a random attack.</p> <p>But on Sunday, her son revealed the alleged killer was one of his former friends.</p> <p>Somawansa said his mother had overcome breast cancer and a series of infections and was finally realising her ambition of becoming a teacher's aide.</p> <p>&quot;She's had so many surgeries and she survived,&quot; he told Seven News.</p> <p>&quot;It all seemed so perfect, it felt like everything was coming together - and it's all gone.&quot;</p> <p>The family moved to Australia from Sri Lanka in 1999.</p> <p>Somawansa spoke of his mother's cooking, saying she was the &quot;person that brought us all together, that made us want to come home after every day&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;Everywhere I went, I wanted to come home to mum,&quot; he said.</p> <p>&quot;She'd always have something cooked for me ... I would smell the food as I would get out of the car ... now she's gone.&quot;</p> <p>Detectives arrested Baea, 21, from Lara, near Geelong, on Saturday before charging him with one count of murder.</p> <p>Dressed in a white-collared shirt, Baea showed no emotion during a brief appearance before the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Sunday.</p> <p>He did not apply for bail and was remanded to face court again for a file hearing on Tuesday.</p> <p>The court heard it was his first time in custody.</p>","images":[{"id":13990345,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T183822+1300","datetime_display":"18:38 22/02/2016","creditline":"SEVEN NEWS","caption":"Prasad Somawansa, 48, was killed in her

He admitted he was the only one in the car when it was snapped speeding along Wharerangi Road in Napier, but said he wasn't guilty and shouldn't have to pay the $80 fine.</p> <p>Representing himself, Barker told Justices of the Peace Hazel Rawstrone and Sandra McNeil that it was &quot;a very simple story&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;On the day I was so called caught by the police camera I had a period of severe - and I mean severe - hay fever. Now this hay fever from September to October was the worst hay fever I've ever had in my life,&quot; Barker said.</p> <p>&quot;I thought I was ill for some reason or other. So I got in my car and drove to the doctor,&quot; he said.</p> <p>But the doctor &quot;could not help me in any way whatsoever&quot;, he said.</p> <p>&quot;So I'm still screaming my brains out, sneezing and coughing all the time. I had no control over anything,&quot; he said.</p> <p>When you live in the country you can't get a doctor to come and see you, he told the JPs.</p> <p>&quot;You can only see a doctor if you're in an emergency and they send an ambulance out to you,&quot; he said in a raised voice.</p> <p>After the doctor he went to the chemist to see if he could get some pills &quot;but they couldn't help me at all either&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;So I had to drive all the way home carefully, without causing an accident... I have no idea how I did the speed limit,&quot; he said.</p> <p>&quot;I'm a careful driver,&quot; he said in conclusion.</p> <p>The JPs pointed out that none of this had much bearing on the speed limit being exceeded.</p> <p>After a brief adjournment to consider the evidence the JPs returned and McNeil told Barker the fine of $80 stood and he needed to pay $30 in court costs.</p> <p>Speaking outside court the retired Barker said he was disappointed with the outcome and felt he had proved his case.</p> <p>&quot;I was in a state with hay fever.

Experts believe the broken shoulders are not an issue with beef cattle.</p> <p>Broken shoulders appeared mostly during peak lactation in September-October, although they also occurred before calving and through to December, Massey University veterinary professor Dave West told farmers at Limestone Downs Station's annual field day.</p> <p>West said a soon-to-be-released study from the university showed this was a serious problem in the dairy industry.</p> <p>&quot;They are spontaneous, there's no history of trauma. You go out into the paddock and you find them. Farmers have reported cows walking past and you hear a bang and there's another one with a broken shoulder.&quot;</p> <p>The issue was first reported in Manawatu in 2008 when a Foxton farm had five cows with broken shoulders. At Limestone Downs, there were 16 cases between August and November last year. All the cows were purchased apart from one which was reared on the farm.</p> <p>Some of the heifers were second calvers and had been on the farm for more than a year before the problem occurred, West said.</p> <p>Based on a random phone survey of 500 farmers, researchers determined that about 10 per cent of all dairy farms had this issue.</p> <p>&quot;It's usually about 2 per cent of first calvers and 2 per cent of second calvers.</p> <p>&quot;If you add up the number of heifers in New Zealand, you're talking 4500-5000 heifers every year in New Zealand are breaking bones,&quot; he said.</p> <p>The estimated loss at this level was about $9.24 million.</p> <p>Broken shoulder reports were found across the country including &quot;quite a few&quot; in Waikato.</p> <p>West said the problem was likely being under reported by farmers.</p> <p>&quot;It's not a nice condition, farmers don't want to admit that they have a problem, sometimes they are put down in the back paddock and they might wait until they have half a dozen and then they &nbsp;might contact the vet.&quot;</p> <p>This is despite farmers knowing there was little a vet could do.</p> <p>Testing from pathologists revealed the bones were&nbsp;osteoporotic, meaning they were weaker and not formed properly. A microscopic examination of the affected bone showed it had been present for some time, and the bones were not formed properly during its growth.</p> <p>Low copper levels were associated with some of the affected cattle, including those at Limestone Downs.</p> <p>West said he found it difficult to accept it was the only cause as copper deficiencies in cattle had occurred for a long time.</p> <p>Research showed the damage was during bone development of cattle while they were still young.</p> <p>&quot;My personal view is that the way we rear calves is the only thing that I can think of that's changed informally throughout the country so dramatically.&quot;</p> <p>He believed that lactation drain was obviously a trigger factor.</p> <p>Whether it was a calcium or protein deficiency among the cattle was unclear.&nbsp;</p> <p>Modern calf rearing minimised the amount of milk fed to dairy calves whereas beef calves still fed off their mother for a much longer period. He believed this was why it was not so much of an issue in the beef industry.</p> <p>Genetics may also be a factor as the injuries had been associated with higher producing cows and some cows may be more susceptible than others.</p> <p>&quot;I personally don't give them credit for creating such a change in our cattle that they are producing so much milk that their bones give way, but it's certainly part of it.&quot;</p> <p>Another contributing factor could be the hangover effect of the drought where post-drought autumn and winter pasture growth was often deficient in minerals.</p> <p>He urged the industry to undertake larger scale and more in-depth research to determine the cause of the injuries.</p>","images":[{"id":13990107,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T180631+1300","datetime_display":"18:06 22/02/2016","creditline":"Peter Meecham","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"Researchers are stumped as to what is causing the estimated 4500-5000 dairy cows that are breaking their shoulders every year.","variants":[{"id":13990107,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456117591/107/13990107.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"60"}]},{"id":13990108,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T180631+1300","datetime_display":"18:06 22/02/2016","creditline":"Peter Meecham","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"Researchers are stumped as to what is causing the estimated 4500-5000 dairy cows that are breaking their shoulders every year.","variants":[{"id":13990108,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456117591/108/13990108.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"620","height":"349"}]},{"id":13990109,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T180631+1300","datetime_display":"18:06 22/02/2016","creditline":"Peter Meecham","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"Researchers are stumped as to what is causing the estimated 4500-5000 dairy cows that are breaking their shoulders every year.","variants":[{"id":13990109,"layout":"Strap Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456117591/109/13990109.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"300","height":"200"}]},{"id":13990111,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T180631+1300","datetime_display":"18:06 22/02/2016","creditline":"Peter Meecham","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"Researchers are stumped as to what is causing the estimated 4500-5000 dairy cows that are breaking their shoulders every year.","variants":[{"id":13990111,"layout":"Defcon Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456117591/111/13990111.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"418","height":"220"}]},{"id":13990112,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T180631+1300","datetime_display":"18:06 22/02/2016","creditline":"Peter Meecham","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"Researchers are stumped as to what is causing the estimated 4500-5000 dairy cows that are breaking their shoulders every year.","variants":[{"id":13990112,"layout":"ipad section splash 956:956","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456117591/112/13990112.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"956","height":"956"}]}],"datetime_unix":1456117542},{"id":77143779,"path":"/business/farming/77143779/WorkSafe-out-to-change-farmers-perceptions","url":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/_json/business/farming/77143779/WorkSafe-out-to-change-farmers-perceptions","section":"Stuff","section-home":"Farming","section-top-level":"Business","layout":"landscape-image","title":"WorkSafe out to change farmers' perceptions","subhead":null,"alt_headline":"WorkSafe out to change farmers' perceptions","datetime_iso8601":"20160222T175454+1300","datetime_display":"17:54 22/02/2016","byline":"BRIAR BABINGTON","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","category_id":"Stuff","stream_id":"stuff/business/farming/77143779","intro":"Driving around his 1500 hectare sheep beef and deer farm with two WorkSafe inspectors in his ute, Pete Turner is anything but a bundle of nerves.","alt_intro":"It's Monday morning and the WorkSafe inspectors are at Pete Turner's Mossburn farm.","body":"<p>Driving around his 1500 hectare sheep beef and deer farm with two WorkSafe inspectors in his ute, Pete Turner is anything but a bundle of nerves.</p> <p>It's Monday morning and the inspectors are at Turner's Mossburn farm for a routine inspection and to chat with him about his health and safety plan.</p> <p>It's something which Turner is all too happy to advocate for.</p> <p>&quot;Farmers need to be able to call these guys and get any info they want and not be scared,&quot;

In 2015, WorkSafe gave out no fines in the Southland area.</p> <p>Perham and Woods sat down with Turner who gave them a comprehensive rundown of his safety guidelines and how he was minimising risk on his farm.</p> <p>Turner said he knew he did not have everything &quot;100 per cent&quot;, but knew it was important to communicate what he had done in the interim to reduce the likelihood of accidents.</p> <p>&quot;I haven't been able to eliminate it [a hazard]... but what can I do to minimise it,&quot; he said.</p> <p>&quot;If you know you've got an issue, you're halfway there of solving it.&quot;</p> <p>After attending a WorkSafe workshop a few years ago, Turner realised his health and safety plan was not up to scratch and was putting himself and his employees at risk.</p> <p>&quot;We had a plan and we realised it was a shocker,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Perham and Woods stressed that having a cohesive plan was not about creating mountains of paperwork.</p> <p>&quot;If you've got volumes and volumes of paperwork, no one's going to read it,&quot; Perham said.</p> <p>&quot;It's not meant to be arduous... the more simple it is the more likely it is to be used,&quot; Woods said.</p> <p>&quot;The whole idea [of having a plan] is to make it easier for farmers.&quot;</p> <p>The new Health and Safety at Work Act, which comes into effect on April 4 to replace the current Health and Safety and Employment Act, will require employers to take steps to manage health and safety risks at work.</p> <p>To coincide with the Act, WorkSafe has set a goal of reducing the number of serious work-related injuries and deaths in New Zealand by at least 25 per cent by 2020.</p> <p>In 2015, 19 people died on farms and the purpose of WorkSafe's inspections is to make sure farmers are taking the best precautions to ensure their staff are in the safest possible working conditions.</p>","images":[{"id":13989981,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T175531+1300","datetime_display":"17:55 22/02/2016","creditline":"ROBYN EDIE/FAIRFAX NZ","caption":"WorkSafe assessment manager

at Barangaroo</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Viva Energy has not said why the fifth stack failed to fall, but theories are circulating in the industry.</p> <p>​Master&nbsp;Builders Association of NSW executive director&nbsp;Brian&nbsp;Seidler said it was unusual for a demolition by controlled explosives to be unsuccessful as it was a highly specialised field.</p> <p>Two of the most common reasons for a &quot;stand-up&quot; - when a structure does not collapse after attempted demolition&nbsp;- include that one or part of the explosive charge did not work.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;The other thought is that the&nbsp;steel used&nbsp;and the concrete used and all of the building material used were far stronger than anticipated,&quot; Seidler said.</p> <p>&quot;But I guess if&nbsp;the four went down reasonably without&nbsp;a problem it is more likely to be a fuse problem than this particular one was built stronger than the rest.&quot;</p> <p>Liberty Industrial&nbsp;founding director Clinton Dick told the ABC on Sunday that he expected it was a demolition cord problem, but a Viva Energy spokeswoman&nbsp;would not confirm this.</p> <p>&quot;At the end of the day, we've had four stacks come down really well,&quot; Dick&nbsp;said.</p> <p>&quot;The method is sound, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it, we just suspect there is a detonation cord problem [with the fifth stack].&quot;</p>

\"the thing she loved most in the world\".","body":"<p>A man jailed for shooting and killing his ex-girlfriend's championship horse after she ended their relationship has had his sentence overturned.</p> <p>Ryan Thomas Finlinson, 23, was jailed for 28 months on an intentional damage charge when he appeared before Christchurch District Court judge Jane Farish in December.</p> <p>During sentencing, the judge quoted from the woman's statement to the Probation Service in which she described shooting the horse as the closest thing to shooting her and said she lost her prized possession, &quot;the thing she loved most in the world&quot;.</p> <p>The woman, whose name is suppressed, chose to end the relationship and the court also suppressed the name of the horse.</p> <p>In the High Court in Christchurch, Justice Gerald Nation outlined the background.</p> <p>At 10pm, on May 1 last year, Finlinson went to the woman's home to collect personal belongings but discovered she was in bed with someone he knew.</p> <p>He left the house, went to a nearby paddock and shot the horse twice in the head.&nbsp;</p> <p>A gun was taken to the property but Finlinson did not take the firearm inside the house.</p> <p>Finlinson's lawyer submitted the jail sentence was excessive and a starting point of three-and-a-half years' jail, before the sentencing judge applied deductions, was too high.</p> <p>He argued the appropriate starting point was two years' jail, which is the threshold for courts to consider an alternative sentence of home detention.</p> <p>Finlinson, in a pre-sentence report, had said he shot the horse &quot;so that she would feel what I was feeling&quot;.</p> <p>Justice Nation said the sentencing judge considered various factors as separate aggravating features of the offending when in reality it was one aggravating matter.</p> <p>&quot;I do not underestimate the emotional impact that the killing of this horse had and was meant to have on [her].</p> <p>&quot;However, I do have a concern that...the judge took into account the emotional impact of what happened as three different aggravating features of the offending, when in reality it was one significantly aggravating matter.&quot;</p> <p>Finlinson immediately went to police, surrendered his firearm and resigned from his job.&nbsp;</p> <p>He also paid $10,000 as reparation.</p> <p>The court considered other cases involving animal cruelty, including the <a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/72919618/paroled-ewen-macdonald-forbidden-to-go-to-north-island.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ewen Macdonald</a> calf-killing case, as part of a balancing exercise.</p> <p>At sentencing care was taken but there were errors, he said.</p> <p>&quot;The killing of an animal, particularly in circumstances such as this, can quickly arouse such feelings of revulsion that considerable care had to be taken to ensure all relevant matters were weighed carefully in arriving at the end sentence.</p> <p>&quot;Those errors resulted in the adoption of a starting point which was too high.&quot;</p> <p>Finlinson was not sufficiently acknowledged for taking responsibility for his actions and there was inadequate recognition of his youthfulness and otherwise good character.</p> <p>The sentence was therefore manifestly excessive and must be quashed, the judge said.</p> <p>Finlinson, who has served two months' jail, was sentenced to eight months' home detention and banned from entering a large part of the South Island during sentence without approval from the Probation Service.</p>","images":[{"id":13990036,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T180144+1300","datetime_display":"18:01 22/02/2016","creditline":"KSENIA RAYKOVA/iSTOCK

A fractured skull. Several other bones broken in the head, including one in an ear. Bleeding on the brain.</p> <p>Muscle damage left one side of his face paralysed for some time.</p> <p>His sister Shinead Cockburn still cries when she remembers how he would not take photos of himself, as he thought he looked ugly.</p> <p>While Jayden Cockburn's face looks better, it is clear when he speaks to <i>Stuff </i>in the week following Teu's sentencing that he is not right.</p> <p>He can only concentrate for small periods at a time - he even gets up and leaves the conversation partway during the interview - because of his injuries.</p> <p>He was supposed to be back at work in July, but has gone back for two part-days instead.

But said just being alive was a blessing.</p> <p>&quot;They said if I wasn't as strong or as fit as I am, I would not have survived.&quot;</p> <p>His family have suffered too. His aunty Amanda Cockburn finds it hard to see how much weight he has lost.</p> <p>His mother&nbsp;suddenly becomes speechless while explaining about how she was unable to see her son in an induced

Cockburn's step-dad Aaron Thornton, are unhappy with the punishment for the offence.</p> <p>Aaron Thornton said sentencing someone to a night-time curfew, regardless of their age, showed that one-punch assaults were not being taken seriously enough.</p> <p>Laws like those recently introduced in Australia, including minimum eight-year sentences for fatal one-punch assaults influenced by drugs or alcohol, would go some way to remedy that, he said.</p> <p>Melissa Thornton agreed.</p> <p>&quot;Why should it take someone being really hurt, beyond being alive, for someone to do something?</p> <p>&quot;[One-punch assaults] happen too often and it's not OK.</p> <p>&quot;We are just really lucky that we have still got Jayden with us.&quot;</p> <p>The lack of acknowledgement

If we can get that out on the park for longer periods we'll put teams under a lot more pressure.&quot;</p> <p>Cane approaches the looming opener against the Crusaders in Christchurch on Saturday night with a fatalistic viewpoint.</p> <p>&quot;We've got to be ready, don't we,&quot; he shrugs.</p> <p>&quot;You always feel like at this time of the year you're little behind where you'd like to be, or you can always cover off a wee bit more. But this week in training we'll narrow our focus on to a few key things or look at what the Crusaders have been doing.</p> <p>&quot;We know it will be another step up. The pre-season is pre-season; come game time in the competition it's a different intensity.&quot;</p> <p>For that reason Cane wasn't reading too much into the 74-7 flogging the Red and Blacks received at the hands of the Hurricanes in their own final hitout.</p> <p>&quot;They'll be in much the same boat as us, and I'm sure they'll move on pretty quick from their final hitout and be looking to put out a good one this week and start off well,&quot; he said.</p> <p>As for the fresh young faces that pepper his squad, Cane offers a realistic but encouraging assessment.</p> <p>&quot;It's going to be a steep learning curve for a few boys, but the ones who step up and take their chances will see plenty of game-time. It's exciting for them and it's exciting for the other boys in the team to have some new guys pushing the rest of us.&quot;</p> <p>Cane, with 31 test caps and six seasons of Super Rugby already under his belt, also understands what an important year it is for himself. For the first time there is no Richie McCaw casting his considerable shadow across the New Zealand rugby landscape.</p> <p>&quot;It's been enjoyable coming back a little earlier and doing some real pre-season work with these guys and going through some of the hard yakka together,&quot; he said. &quot;That's been a real positive and I feel ready and excited about the season ahead.&quot;</p>","images":[{"id":13989690,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T172017+1300","datetime_display":"17:20 22/02/2016","creditline":"GEORGE HEARD/FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"waikato-times","source_name":"Waikato Times","caption":"Sam Cane says the Chiefs have to get their hands on more ball when they launch their Super Rugby season in Christchurch.","variants":[{"id":13989690,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456114817/690/13989690.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"60"}]},{"id":13989691,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T172018+1300","datetime_display":"17:20 22/02/2016","creditline":"GEORGE HEARD/FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"waikato-times","source_name":"Waikato Times","caption":"Sam Cane says the Chiefs have to get their hands on more ball when they launch their Super Rugby season in Christchurch.","variants":[{"id":13989691,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456114818/691/13989691.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"618","height":"349"}]},{"id":13989692,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T172018+1300","datetime_display":"17:20 22/02/2016","creditline":"GEORGE HEARD/FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"waikato-times","source_name":"Waikato Times","caption":"Sam Cane says the Chiefs have to get their hands on more ball when they launch their Super Rugby season in Christchurch.","variants":[{"id":13989692,"layout":"Strap Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456114818/692/13989692.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"300","height":"200"}]},{"id":13989694,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T172018+1300","datetime_display":"17:20 22/02/2016","creditline":"GEORGE HEARD/FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"waikato-times","source_name":"Waikato Times","caption":"Sam Cane says the Chiefs have to get their hands on more ball when they launch their Super Rugby season in Christchurch.","variants":[{"id":13989694,"layout":"Defcon Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456114818/694/13989694.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"418","height":"220"}]},{"id":13989695,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T172018+1300","datetime_display":"17:20 22/02/2016","creditline":"GEORGE HEARD/FAIRFAX NZ","source_code":"waikato-times","source_name":"Waikato Times","caption":"Sam Cane says the Chiefs have to get their hands on more ball when they launch their Super Rugby season in Christchurch.","variants":[{"id":13989695,"layout":"ipad section splash 956:956","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456114818/695/13989695.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"956","height":"956"}]}],"datetime_unix":1456114800},{"id":77156562,"path":"/business/77156562/Survey-shows-young-people-struggle-with-budgeting-saving","url":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/_json/business/77156562/Survey-shows-young-people-struggle-with-budgeting-saving","section":"Stuff","section-home":"Business","section-top-level":"Business","layout":"landscape-image","title":"Survey shows young people struggle with budgeting, saving","subhead":null,"alt_headline":"Kiwi kids lack money skills","datetime_iso8601":"20160222T171837+1300","datetime_display":"17:18 22/02/2016","byline":"SUSAN EDMUNDS","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","category_id":"Stuff","stream_id":"stuff/business/77156562","intro":"Whether it is compound interest compared to the icing on a cake or debt likened to a stone in your school backpack, parents can help their kids grasp financial concepts by relating them back to everyday life, a researcher says.","alt_intro":"Do you know how to give your kids the best financial start in life?","body":"<p>Whether it is compound interest compared to the icing on a cake or debt likened to a stone in your school backpack, parents can help their kids grasp financial concepts by relating them back to everyday life, a researcher says.</p> <p>A new survey, the Westpac Massey Fin-Ed Centre 2015 Student Financial Health Check, has found young New Zealanders lack budgeting, saving and investing skills.</p> <p>The survey of nearly 300 16- to 19-year-olds was developed in conjunction with high school teachers to test the competence levels of students across a range of personal finance areas.</p> <p>The average score for questions relating to budgeting and financial management was only 37 out of 100.

And if they don't understand how best to grow their savings, then that will have a long-term impact over their lifetimes.&quot;</p> <p>She said parents should start having regular conversations about money with their kids. &quot;The key is for parents to make sure they make money a normal topic of conversation, rather than a topic of pain and agony. They should be talking about 'let's plan how we spend the money we have', being positive rather than negative.&quot;</p> <p>If a child wanted to buy an expensive toy, instead of saying no outright, parents could offer to budget and plan how the child could afford it in future.</p> <p>&quot;Turning the conversation into a positive learning experience for them. If you want children to be savvy with money you need to start with equipping them with the tools.&quot;</p> <p>She said a concept such as compound interest sounded difficult but parents could make it simple to understand by comparing it to icing on a cake. &quot;The cake is the capital and the icing is the interest,&quot; she said.</p> <p>Debt could be likened to a stone being carried around in a backpack. &quot;Compound interest when you are borrowing is like adding more weight. it's making it as simple and as palatable as possible.&quot;</p> <p>Young people needed to be told early on that they could not have everything they wanted as soon as they wanted it, she said.</p> <p>Wood said the results were concerning because efforts had been made for 10 years to improve New Zealanders' financial skills. &quot;Maybe we need to start looking at a joined-up approach rather than schools teaching one thing and then the parents [teaching something else]. But in my opinion it needs to start at home, then schools strengthen it.&quot;</p> <p>Westpac NZ acting head of investments and insurance Nigel Jackson said the results underlined Westpac's belief that financial education should be a compulsory subject in New Zealand schools.</p> <p>&quot;Every student should have a basic understanding of financial management by the time they leave school,&quot; he said. &quot;It's never too early to get in the habit of setting long-term financial goals and strong budget management through the student years can make a real difference after graduation.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;While we'd expect students to be less focused on saving and investing, simply having a KiwiSaver account for after graduation could play an important role in long-term financial security.&quot;</p> <p>The survey respondents scored best in the areas of identifying and managing risk and understanding their rights and responsibilities.</p> <p>&quot;It's great that kids seem to understand their rights and that they are able to identify risks,&quot; Wood said. &quot;It seems that this age group is much less likely to fall victim to a scammer than our senior citizens.&quot;</p>","images":[{"id":13989672,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T171902+1300","datetime_display":"17:19 22/02/2016","creditline":"KENT BLECHYNDEN/FAIRFAX MEDIA","source_code":"fairfax-media","source_name":"Fairfax Media","caption":"Pushpa Wood says parents should take the lead in helping their kids learn about money.","variants":[{"id":13989672,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456114742/672/13989672.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"60"}]},{"id":13989673,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T171902+1300","datetime_display":"17:19 22/02/2016","creditline":"KENT BLECHYNDEN/FAIRFAX MEDIA","source_code":"fairfax-media","source_name":"Fairfax Media","caption":"Pushpa Wood says parents should take the lead in helping their kids learn about money.","variants":[{"id":13989673,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456114742/673/13989673.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"620","height":"349"}]},{"id":13989674,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T171902+1300","datetime_display":"17:19 22/02/2016","creditline":"KENT BLECHYNDEN/FAIRFAX MEDIA","source_code":"fairfax-media","source_name":"Fairfax Media","caption":"Pushpa Wood says parents should take the lead in helping their kids learn about money.","variants":[{"id":13989674,"layout":"Strap Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456114742/674/13989674.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"300","height":"200"}]},{"id":13989676,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T171902+1300","datetime_display":"17:19 22/02/2016","creditline":"KENT BLECHYNDEN/FAIRFAX MEDIA","source_code":"fairfax-media","source_name":"Fairfax Media","caption":"Pushpa Wood says parents should take the lead in helping their kids learn about money.","variants":[{"id":13989676,"layout":"Defcon Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456114742/676/13989676.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"418","height":"220"}]},{"id":13989677,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T171902+1300","datetime_display":"17:19 22/02/2016","creditline":"KENT BLECHYNDEN/FAIRFAX MEDIA","source_code":"fairfax-media","source_name":"Fairfax Media","caption":"Pushpa Wood says parents should take the lead in helping their kids learn about money.","variants":[{"id":13989677,"layout":"ipad section splash 956:956","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456114742/677/13989677.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"956","height":"956"}]}],"datetime_unix":1456114717},{"id":77144809,"path":"/sport/rugby/super-rugby/77144809/Hurricanes-coach-Chris-Boyd-laments-the-lame-Super-Rugbys-conference-system","url":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/_json/sport/rugby/super-rugby/77144809/Hurricanes-coach-Chris-Boyd-laments-the-lame-Super-Rugbys-conference-system","section":"Stuff","section-home":"Super Rugby","section-top-level":"Sport","layout":"landscape-video","title":"Hurricanes coach Chris Boyd laments the lame Super Rugby's conference system","subhead":null,"alt_headline":"Big task for NZ Super sides","datetime_iso8601":"20160222T171441+1300","datetime_display":"17:14 22/02/2016","byline":"HAMISH BIDWELL","category_id":"Stuff","stream_id":"stuff/sport/rugby/super-rugby/77144809","intro":"A look through the Hurricanes' Super Rugby draw can be a dispiriting exercise.","alt_intro":"With worthy offshore opponents in thin supply, there's only one decent conference in Super Rugby.","body":"<p>A look through the Hurricanes' Super Rugby draw can be a dispiriting exercise.</p> <p>Sure there are some worthy opponents in there - the Chiefs, Highlanders, Crusaders and Blues immediately stand out - but the same can't be said for all of them.</p> <p>The marketing departments and diehard fans might relish the thought of opponents such as the Kings at Westpac Stadium on March 25, but no-one else does.

But without people moaning, who knows how many more teams will roped in to further dilute the product?</p> <p>Boyd, who has coaching at the Sharks on his resume, was too savvy to outright slate the Australian conference or the two South African ones, but there was little doubting the point he was trying to make.</p> <p>&quot;The interesting thing, if you look at the pools, you'd say that the New Zealand pool, you'd think, is a relatively strong pool and there's not too many walkovers in the pool that's for sure, for any side,&quot; Boyd said on Monday.</p> <p>&quot;So to swim your way to the top of the New Zealand pool and get a home quarterfinal is going to be a massive objective probably for everyone in New Zealand. Then after that there's a couple of away quarterfinal spots that people will be chasing.&quot;</p> <p>So - and again these aren't news flashes - not only are the New Zealand sides penalised by having to play each other twice a season, their reward is to see inferior sides receive playoff berths on the basis of geography.</p> <p>Conferences might be all the rage in American sport, but they niggle at the New Zealand sense of fair play.</p> <p>&quot;The Aussies will say that the Aussie derbies are brutal and the South Africans certainly say that the South African derbies are brutal, so I think all derbies have a bit of an edge on them,&quot; said Boyd.</p> <p>&quot;But I think the thing about it for the New Zealand conference is that there's five absolutely world class teams, in my opinion, in the New Zealand conference. Whereas, perhaps, in the other conferences there might be two or three, but there's certainly not five.&quot;</p> <p>The Hurricanes come into the 2016 campaign in curious form. They began their preseason with a 28-0 loss to the Western Force, which Boyd disregards, before being beaten 40-12 by the Blues and finally towelling up the Crusaders 74-7.</p> <p>Boyd reckons he knows what sort of performances he'll get when they play the Brumbies in Canberra on Friday. He also has a fairly full squad to pick from, with Matt Proctor (knee) and James Broadhurst (concussion) being two of the more notable players unavailable.</p>","images":[{"id":13989599,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T171247+1300","datetime_display":"17:12 22/02/2016","creditline":null,"caption":"*","variants":[{"id":13989599,"layout":"Small

href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/capital-life/8513694/Flashback-Wahine-disaster-45-years-on\">Flashback: Wahine disaster 45 years on</a></b></p> <p>Firstly, we need to make two things clear: Remnants of the deadly storm are <a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/77107882/remnants-of-cyclone-winston-could-touch-new-zealand\">likely to track towards New Zealand by the end of the week</a> but it will be significantly weaker and will likely bring strong winds and heavy rain - not widespread destruction.&nbsp;</p> <p>Also, a storm of this nature has never hit New Zealand and is not likely to. Tropical Cyclones lose a lot of their steam as they pass over the cold water above New Zealand.</p> <p>About 10 per cent of tropical cyclones re-intensify before hitting us but even the worst storms in our country's recorded history had nothing on Winston as far as wind speeds and pressure goes.</p> <p>That aside, a strong tropical cyclone or storm with high wind speeds and low pressure could certainly wreak havoc on Wellington.</p> <p>MetService expert meteorologist and author Erick Brenstrum said a storm like this would bring down trees and power lines, blow in windows, flood rivers, and cause storm surges that would lead to flooding and ripped up roads in coastal areas.</p> <p>Brenstrum said the best way to get an idea of what could happen was to look back to some of the country's worst storms.</p> <p>The storm that prefaced the Wahine disaster rocked the capital almost 48 years ago.</p> <p>The storm had wind speeds of 150 kilometres an hour, with gusts up to 190kmh, Brenstrum said.</p> <p>On April 10, 1968 houses lost their roofs and trees came down.</p> <p>While the sinking of the Wahine led to the deaths of 53 people, the storm wasn't to blame for the scale of the disaster, he said.</p> <p>If there was a storm to rival the Wahine storm it came in 1936.</p> <p>&quot;For me the details of 1936 are just mind-bending,&quot; Brenstrum said.</p> <p>Bits of road and rail links were strewn everywhere and about a million trees came down that day.</p> <p>Buildings, including a historic Rotorua church and all of Palmerston North's grandstands came down in the storm.</p> <p>A train was blown off the line south of Palmerston North, rivers flooded and every province in the North Island, along with Marlborough, suffered extensive damage.</p> <p>Eight people lost their lives in the storm, Brenstrum said.</p> <p>But even the 1936 storm, the worst storm to hit New Zealand in 100 years, still had nothing on Winston in terms of wind speeds and pressure.</p> <p>Brenstrum said 90 per cent of storm fatalities were caused by storm surges, where the low-pressure system caused sea levels to rise and flood coastal areas.</p> <p>Winston's pressure got down to 917hPa, while the storm of '36 got as low as 965hPa.</p> <p>When Wellington was <a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/8824068/Wellington-cleaning-up-wind-whipped-city\">hit by a severe storm in 2013</a>, it was this low pressure and coastal storm surge that did extensive damage to coastal roads.</p> <p>The South Coast was described as a &quot;bombsite&quot; after high tides and storm surges led to water covering the roads and damaging the sea wall.</p> <p>Brenstrum said regions fared differently when storms hit.&nbsp;</p> <p>Wellington had become accustomed to withstanding strong winds and the trees could take more of a hammering than those in Auckland, for example.</p> <p>Even if a storm with Winston's intensity did hit the capital, it was likely the buildings would withstand the wind and rain better than some of the less-sound structures in Pacific nations like Fiji.</p> <p>Kiwis could feel safe in the knowledge that even if Winston did come our way it would only be the &quot;grandchild&quot; of the fierce storm it once was.</p> <p>Brenstrum said there was also a chance it could make a move for Queensland, &quot;and who am I to stand in its way?&quot;</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Damn Second Strongest in the world <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TCWinston?src=hash\">#TCWinston</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CycloneWinston?src=hash\">#CycloneWinston</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/qFVL21DBuT\">pic.twitter.com/qFVL21DBuT</a></p>&mdash; Dan Paris Matanimeke (@PARIICHIQUE) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PARIICHIQUE/status/701566814350737408\">February 22, 2016</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>","images":[{"id":13989532,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T170942+1300","datetime_display":"17:09 22/02/2016","creditline":"REUTERS","caption":"Damaged power lines and flooding are hampering relief efforts in Fiji after Cyclone Winston tore through the country.","variants":[{"id":13989532,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456114182/532/13989532.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"60"}]},{"id":13989533,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T170942+1300","datetime_display":"17:09 22/02/2016","creditline":"NZDF/FACEBOOK","caption":"A Tropical Cyclone with Winston's intensity has never hit New Zealand and it's likely it never will -

It also threatened to disclose the matter publicly.</p> <p>Kerr, who developed a rival product to 1080 –&nbsp;the cyanide-based poison Feratox –&nbsp;pleaded guilty in December.</p> <p>On Monday he began a disputed facts hearing as to the details of his offending.</p> <p>Kerr had initially had his name suppressed but his lawyer John Billington, QC, said his client had agreed his name could be published.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>READ MORE:<br /> *&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/72967112/Recap-1080-contamination-milk-scare-investigation\">Recap: 1080 milk scare investigation<br /> </a>*&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/73001821/1080-protester-told-police-where-to-look-for-blackmailer\">Protester told police where to find alleged blackmailer</a></b></p> <p>At the High Court on Monday, Crown prosecutor Christine Gordon QC said the disputed facts hearing would centre around what benefit, if any, Kerr expected to obtain from his offending.&nbsp;</p> <p>She said Kerr had claimed he had nothing against the 1080 pesticide but over the years the eradication of possums had reached a &quot;maintenance&quot; stage and royalties he obtained from &nbsp;Feratox were dwindling.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gordon said he became &quot;agitated&quot; and came to believe sales of his own product would increase by 30 per cent if 1080 wasn't used.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;His issues with 1080 were of a commercial point of view. Where it was used, Feratox wasn't,&quot; she said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The court heard that Kerr's company developed Feratox, a pellet preferred by possum fur companies because it preserved its fur after death.&nbsp;</p> <p>Witness statements from former company managers said Kerr had nothing against 1080 as a toxin, and had carried out some developmental work on the poison before moving onto Feratox.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, they said Kerr became concerned that 1080 was outdoing sales of Feratox, and would ask company managers on a daily basis how Feratox sales were doing.&nbsp;</p> <p>A co-founder of the company that sold the pesticide said Kerr was &quot;extravagant&quot; and &quot;generous&quot; with his money and described the royalties Kerr received from Feratox as so significant that it drained the funds of the business.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;He would always be dreaming of boats and holidays and would always be spending money. For Jeremy, money was always in the background for everything he did.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p>He said Feratox could in no way be a replacement for 1080 because it couldn't be aerially dropped, however if 1080 ceased to be sold it could increase Feratox sales.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fourteen witnesses were due to give evidence over the coming days.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>A $3 MILLION INVESTIGATION</b></p> <p>* The investigation cost police more than $3 million, and about 35 officers were put on the case.</p> <p>* More than 2600 people were considered as possible suspects, with more than 60 &quot;significant persons of interest&quot; approached for interviews.</p> <p>* Orders from our biggest dairy market, China, slumped and the Chinese Government announced no milk powder would be let through until it was tested.</p> <p>* Every tanker of raw milk processed by Fonterra was tested. All paediatric products and nutritional powders were also tested. </p> <p>* By the time Kerr was arrested, the Ministry for Primary Industries and manufacturers had carried out 150,000 batch tests.</p> <p>* Diary farmers said whoever had made the threat was a &quot;coward&quot;, amid fears it would harm the industry, already struggling with drought and low prices. </p> <p>* Despite assurances from authorities, some parents were left stressed and worried, with many turning over tins of formula to police, fearing they had been tampered with. &nbsp;</p> <p><i>* Connovation Ltd and Connovation Research Ltd have issued a statement noting that its companies are not connected to any operated by Jeremy Kerr, saying there is an unfortunate similarity in the former names of his companies used at the time of his offence.

Most were left with cuts and bruises, but some were taken from the scene on stretchers with braces around their necks.</p> <p>The bus driver was seen slumped on the ground near the bus, with a bloodied face and legs, before he was taken from the scene on a stretcher.&nbsp;</p> <p>Eleven passengers had been taken to hospital for observation, as well as the bus driver.</p> <p>An attendee at the Asia-Pacific Incentives and Meetings conference said that the passengers on the bus had been travelling around Melbourne for a morning session to visit local landmarks and venues, and were due to return to the Melbourne Convention Centre at Southbank for lunch.</p> <p>Instead, about 600 shocked delegates were told the news that their colleagues had been involved in the crash, and were lucky to be alive.</p> <p>Described as the largest international tourism and events conference in Australia, the AIME started on Monday morning, and would run until Wednesday.</p> <p>&quot;There was a lot of people at the luncheon who just started looking at their tablets and their phone and couldn't believe it had happened,&quot; a conference delegate said.</p> <p>&quot;Everyone was like 'it could have been us'.</p> <p>&quot;It's really unfortunate it's happened at a conference where people are looking at investing in Australia for tourism and major events.&quot;</p> <p>Metropolitan Fire Brigade commander Andrew O'Connell said the ordeal would have been &quot;absolutely terrifying&quot; for the people on board.</p> <p>&quot;Luckily ... they all ducked their heads and closed their eyes to keep themselves out of trouble. And I think that's actually helped them remarkably keep uninjured,&quot; he said.</p> <p>The roof of the bus had to be peeled back and several front seats removed before firefighters could reach the trapped passengers.</p> <p>O'Connell praised the firefighters for managing to free the passengers from such a small area within an hour.</p> <p>He said the height of the rail bridge would have been just above the passengers' head height.</p> <p>&quot;When I responded to this particular call it sounded very nasty and I am very grateful ... that when we arrived we found no one with significant injuries,&quot; O'Connell said.</p> <p>&quot;[The bus] seems to have been driven in at considerable speed.&quot;</p> <p>By midday, a tow truck was preparing to remove the bus from the scene, while authorities had begun picking up debris from the road.&nbsp;</p> <p>About the same time, the Gold Bus Ballarat logos on the side of the bus were covered with grey tape. It is not known who covered the logo, or for what reason.</p> <p>Montague Street in South Melbourne is closed in both directions between Normanby Road and City Road.</p> <p>The Victoria state roading authority, VicRoads, has advised motorists in the area to use Ingles Street.</p> <p>The road is expected to remain closed until at least 5.30pm (7.30pm NZT), while authorities inspect the bridge's safety barrier, a VicRoads spokesman said.</p> <p>The spokesman said a crane was needed to help with the repairs.</p> <p>Witnesses said it appeared the bus was almost a metre higher than the bridge's minimal clearance, and that it struck the bridge without slowing.</p> <p>&quot;It was scary,&quot; car salesman Ramsey Melhem, who works at nearby South Melbourne Toyota, said.</p> <p>&quot;Something is always happening down there with the trucks - things falling off - but this takes it to a new level.</p> <p>&quot;I just don't understand how he [the driver] could have hit it. It was pretty obvious that he wasn't going to get through.&quot;</p> <p>A local storage business operator, who asked to be known only as Tim, said the crash sounded like a regular car crash.</p> <p>&quot;Only the sound went on for longer,&quot; he said.</p> <p>He said the bridge was a constant problem for trucks and other tall vehicles.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;Usually it is air conditioning units coming off trucks - it happens every other week,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Tim said there were insufficient warnings for truck and bus drivers about the upcoming bridge and suggested flashing lights were needed for approaching drivers.</p> <p>Inspector Jo Dolan said police had not yet had a chance to interview the bus driver. She said she expected VicRoads would review safety measures at the bridge.</p> <p>Route 109 trams, which run over the bridge, were suspended for 10 minutes.</p> <p>&quot;It is safe for our trams to be running along there now,&quot; a Yarra Trams spokeswoman said about 11.30am.</p> <p>The spokeswoman said a Yarra Trams operations officer was at the scene, working with emergency services.</p> <p>The bus crash is the latest in a series involving rail bridges, the worst of which saw a truck roll over at the intersection of Flinders and Spencer streets bringing the city to a halt on February 1.</p> <p>Earlier this month, a truck struck a rail bridge at Newmarket.</p> <p>In 2006, a bus carrying Commonwealth Games volunteers crashed into the same light rail bridge over Montague Street. No one was seriously injured in that crash.</p> <p>Matthew Baird, director of Gold Bus Ballarat, said that the company was working closely with emergency services.</p> <p>He said further details of the crash would be provided as soon as the facts were clarified.</p> <p>&quot;Our first priority is the welfare of the passengers and our driver, and assisting emergency services where we can,&quot; he said.</p> <p>The Gold Bus Ballarat fleet are part of 300 buses and coaches owned and operated by the Donric​ Group, which also runs the Sunbury Bus Service, Coach Tours of Australia, Bacchus Marsh

formula with 1080 was a business ploy to drive sales of a competitor possum poison, the Crown says. &nbsp;</p> <p>Businessman Jeremy Hamish Kerr, 60, appeared in the High Court at Auckland on Monday after pleading guilty to two counts of attempted blackmail.</p> <p>Police revealed in March 2015 that Fonterra and Federated Farmers had received threatening letters, along with milk packages that tested positive for the poison.</p> <p>The letters threatened to contaminate infant formula and other products if New Zealand did not cease to use the poison. It also threatened to disclose the matter publicly.</p> <p>Kerr, who developed a rival product to 1080 –&nbsp;the cyanide-based poison Feratox –&nbsp;pleaded guilty in December.</p> <p>On Monday he began a disputed facts hearing as to the details of his offending.</p> <p>Kerr had initially had his name suppressed but his lawyer John Billington, QC, said his client had agreed his name could be published.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>READ MORE:<br /> *&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/72967112/Recap-1080-contamination-milk-scare-investigation\">Recap: 1080 milk scare investigation<br /> </a>*&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/73001821/1080-protester-told-police-where-to-look-for-blackmailer\">Protester told police where to find alleged blackmailer</a></b></p> <p>At the High Court on Monday, Crown prosecutor Christine Gordon QC said the disputed facts hearing would centre around what benefit, if any, Kerr expected to obtain from his offending.&nbsp;</p> <p>She said Kerr had claimed he had nothing against the 1080 pesticide but over the years the eradication of possums had reached a &quot;maintenance&quot; stage and royalties he obtained from &nbsp;Feratox were dwindling.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gordon said he became &quot;agitated&quot; and came to believe sales of his own product would increase by 30 per cent if 1080 wasn't used.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;His issues with 1080 were of a commercial point of view. Where it was used, Feratox wasn't,&quot; she said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The court heard that Kerr's company developed Feratox, a pellet preferred by possum fur companies because it preserved its fur after death.&nbsp;</p> <p>Witness statements from former company managers said Kerr had nothing against 1080 as a toxin, and had carried out some developmental work on the poison before moving onto Feratox.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, they said Kerr became concerned that 1080 was outdoing sales of Feratox, and would ask company managers on a daily basis how Feratox sales were doing.&nbsp;</p> <p>A co-founder of the company that sold the pesticide said Kerr was &quot;extravagant&quot; and &quot;generous&quot; with his money and described the royalties Kerr received from Feratox as so significant that it drained the funds of the business.&nbsp;</p> <p>&quot;He would always be dreaming of boats and holidays and would always be spending money. For Jeremy, money was always in the background for everything he did.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p>He said Feratox could in no way be a replacement for 1080 because it couldn't be aerially dropped, however if 1080 ceased to be sold it could increase Feratox sales.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fourteen witnesses were due to give evidence over the coming days.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>A $3 MILLION INVESTIGATION</b></p> <p>* The investigation cost police more than $3 million, and about 35 officers were put on the case.</p> <p>* More than 2600 people were considered as possible suspects, with more than 60 &quot;significant persons of interest&quot; approached for interviews.</p> <p>* Orders from our biggest dairy market, China, slumped and the Chinese Government announced no milk powder would be let through until it was tested.</p> <p>* Every tanker of raw milk processed by Fonterra was tested. All paediatric products and nutritional powders were also tested. </p> <p>* By the time Kerr was arrested, the Ministry for Primary Industries and manufacturers had carried out 150,000 batch tests.</p> <p>* Diary farmers said whoever had made the threat was a &quot;coward&quot;, amid fears it would harm the industry, already struggling with drought and low prices. </p> <p>* Despite assurances from authorities, some parents were left stressed and worried, with many turning over tins of formula to police, fearing they had been tampered with. &nbsp;</p> <p><i>* Connovation Ltd and Connovation Research Ltd have issued a statement noting that its companies are not connected to any operated by Jeremy Kerr, saying there is an unfortunate similarity in the former names of his companies used at the time of his offence. There is no common shareholding, no common ownership, and no common management between its companies and his businesses, Connovation said.</i></p>","images":[{"id":13991010,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T201714+1300","datetime_display":"20:17 22/02/2016","creditline":"LAWRENCE SMITH/FAIRFAX MEDIA","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"Jeremy Kerr appeared in the High Court in Auckland on Monday.","variants":[{"id":13991010,"layout":"Small Thumbnail","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456125434/010/13991010.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"90","height":"60"}]},{"id":13991011,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T201714+1300","datetime_display":"20:17 22/02/2016","creditline":"LAWRENCE SMITH/FAIRFAX MEDIA","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"Jeremy Kerr appeared in the High Court in Auckland on Monday.","variants":[{"id":13991011,"layout":"Standard Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456125434/011/13991011.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"620","height":"349"}]},{"id":13991012,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T201714+1300","datetime_display":"20:17 22/02/2016","creditline":"LAWRENCE SMITH/FAIRFAX MEDIA","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"Jeremy Kerr appeared in the High Court in Auckland on Monday.","variants":[{"id":13991012,"layout":"Strap Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456125434/012/13991012.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"300","height":"200"}]},{"id":13991014,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T201714+1300","datetime_display":"20:17 22/02/2016","creditline":"LAWRENCE SMITH/FAIRFAX MEDIA","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"Jeremy Kerr appeared in the High Court in Auckland on Monday.","variants":[{"id":13991014,"layout":"Defcon Image","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456125434/014/13991014.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"418","height":"220"}]},{"id":13991015,"datetime_iso8601":"20160222T201715+1300","datetime_display":"20:17 22/02/2016","creditline":"LAWRENCE SMITH/FAIRFAX MEDIA","source_code":"1national-newsroom","source_name":"Stuff","caption":"Jeremy Kerr appeared in the High Court in Auckland on Monday.","variants":[{"id":13991015,"layout":"ipad section splash 956:956","src":"http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1456125435/015/13991015.jpg","media_type":"Photo","width":"956","height":"956"}]}],"datetime_unix":1456118165},{"id":77125182,"url":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/science/77125182/Mysterious-sounds-heard-by-Nasa-astronauts-on-dark-side-of-the-Moon","title":"Mysterious sounds heard by Nasa astronauts on dark side of the Moon"},{"id":77138001,"url":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/well-good/teach-me/77138001/Clever-uses-for-Vaseline-around-the-house","title":"Clever uses for Vaseline around the house"}]}}
